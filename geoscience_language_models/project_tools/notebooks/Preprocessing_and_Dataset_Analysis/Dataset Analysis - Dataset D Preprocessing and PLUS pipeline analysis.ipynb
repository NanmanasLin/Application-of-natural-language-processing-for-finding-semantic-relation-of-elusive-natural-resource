       "      <td>We  then  calculated  the  Cu  isotope  composition  for  each  HM  scenario \\nrequired to drive the equilibrating silicate (i.e. the mantle) towards the modern-\\nday BSE value. This is shown in Figure 3b, where a smaller HM results in a more \\nnegative HM Cu isotope composition. We calculate a range of HM Cu isotope \\ncompositions because our preliminary experiments were simply used to assess the \\nsense, not the magnitude of isotope fractionation; however, because large isotope \\nfractionations (&gt; 2 ‰) are not expected at the temperatures associated with the \\nformation of a HM (3000-4000 K), a minimum thickness of ~2 km is predicted, \\neven for the most Cu-rich HM. The maximum size for each HM as controlled \\nby its Cu concentration corresponds to a minimum Δ65Cusulphide-silicate value of \\n~ –0.6 ‰. To further constrain this model, further work is required to accurately \\nparameterise  Cu  isotope  fractionation  factors,  but  these  model  predictions  are \\nin general agreement with our experimental data (Supplementary Information).\\nAdmixing a Fe-O-S liquid into Earth’s core will affect core composition, \\nspecifically  with  regard  to  the  light  elements  S  and  O.  Given  the  constraints \\nprovided above (HM mass ≤ 1.6 % of Earth’s core), addition of a HM to the core \\nwill have a small effect on the core O composition (&lt; 0.25 wt. % addition); for S, \\nthe effect is more significant – our model suggests that up to ~0.5 wt. % S could be \\nadded (Fig. 3a), which is in line with recent estimates based on molecular dynamics \\n(Badro  et  al.,  2014)  and  siderophile  element  partitioning  studies  (Siebert  et  al., \\n2013) – of course, this does not preclude further core addition of S as a metal alloy.\\nFinally, we estimate the effect that removal of the HM could have on mantle \\nlead isotope composition. Lead can be strongly chalcophile, and an early fraction-\\nation of isotopically primitive Pb by a sulphide-rich phase is often cited as a solu-\\ntion to the 1st terrestrial Pb paradox; that is, the observation that, in 206Pb/204Pb \\nvs. 207Pb/204Pb space, most mantle-derived rocks, continental sediments etc. plot \\nto the right of the terrestrial geochron (either the meteoritic, 4.568 Ga geochron \\nor the later Hf-W core formation cessation age of ~4.53 Ga, Fig. 4; Kramers and \\nTolstikhin,  1997).  Modelling  the  evolution  of  mantle  Pb  isotope  composition \\nresulting  from  two  fractionation  events,  metal-silicate  equilibration  at  50  Ma \\nand  sulphide-silicate  equilibration  at  100  Ma  (following  Galer  and  Goldstein, \\n1996; see Supplementary Information for details), predicts a present-day mantle \\nPb isotopic composition that is comparable to empirical estimates for BSE, albeit \\nthe more unradiogenic ones (Fig. 4; Halliday, 2004) as well as the Pb composi-\\ntion  of  the  ancient  primitive  mantle  as  estimated  using  flood  basalts  (Jackson \\nand  Carlson,  2011).  Therefore,  this  does  not  preclude  further  unradiogenic  Pb \\nreservoirs, such as sulphides in refractory mantle phases (Burton et al., 2012) or \\nlate accretion of mantle Pb (Albarède, 2009).\\n</td>\n",

However,  within  the  3–30  m  interval  that  contains  the \\ncalcareous and grey shale we observed flaser, pin-stripe and lenticular bedding; \\nmultiple  reactivation  surfaces;  mud  drapes  and  herringbone  cross-lamination \\n(Fig. 1). These features are strong evidence of tidally influenced sedimentation on \\nmarine tidal flats (Davis Jr., 2012). Closely interfingered marine and non-marine \\ndeposition is not uncommon in the rock record. For example, recent discoveries \\nof tidal indicators in the Ordovician Juniata Formation raised doubts about some \\nof the oldest purported evidence for land colonisation by animal life (Davies et al., \\n2010). Our sedimentological observations raise similar concerns for the eukary-\\notic biota of the Stoer Group (Cloud and Germs, 1971). This view is supported \\nby our geochemical data, which are most parsimoniously explained by a marine \\ninfluence during the deposition of the middle Poll a’Mhuilt Member (~3–30 m).\\nCarbonate-bound  87Sr/86Sr  ratios  capture  the  isotope  composition  of  the \\nwater column in which the carbonate precipitated. As typical continental runoff \\nis more radiogenic (87Sr-enriched) than seawater, 87Sr/86Sr values can distinguish \\nbetween marine and non-marine environments (Veizer et al., 1990; Spencer and \\nPatchett,  1997).  However,  infiltration  of  secondary  fluids  during  early  or  late \\ndiagenesis  typically  increases  carbonate  87Sr/86Sr  ratios  (Banner  and  Hanson, \\n1990). Covariation and low values of δ18Ocarb and δ13Ccarb, as seen in our samples, \\nmay indicate some degree of alteration by continental fluids (Fig. 3c) (Shields and \\nVeizer, 2002; Bartley and Kah, 2004). However, alteration almost always leads to \\nmore  radiogenic  carbonate  87Sr/86Sr  ratios  (Banner  and  Hanson,  1990).  Diage-\\nnetic fluids were likely sourced from the surrounding land surface and should \\nhave reflected the composition of the Lewisian tonalite-trondjemite-granodiorite \\ngneiss (0.740 ± 0.033; Lyon et al., 1975; this study; and see Supplementary Informa-\\ntion for discussion). Therefore, the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of our least radiogenic carbonate \\nend-member  (0.707,  Fig.  3b),  directly  from  within  the  sulphide-  and  Mo-rich \\ninterval  (Parnell  et  al.,  2015),  provides  a  maximum  constraint  for  the  primary \\n87Sr/86Sr ratio of the water body from which the carbonate precipitated. This value \\nis too low to reflect exclusively continental runoff from the Lewisian basement \\n(&gt;0.715), which should dominate the signal in a lacustrine setting.

The benchmark structure was built with a 4 × 2 column scheme (4 columns in the\\ntransversal direction (8 m spaced) and 2 in the longitudinal direction (10 m spaced)) and modelled to\\nhave periods in the range of those of residential buildings, considering 3 ﬂoors (a 3.4 m storey height,\\nwith a total structure height of 10.2 m). The structure was modelled as a superposition of two schemes\\n(Figure 6). Both vertical and horizontal elements were composed by RC concrete columns and beams,\\nrespectively, and characterized by ﬁber section models. Concrete02 material [56,57] was chosen to\\nmodel the core and the cover portions (Figure 7a,b, respectively) of the section (0.40 m × 0.40 m) and\\nwith the parameters deﬁned in Table 2. The ratio between the unloading slope (related to the maximum\\nstrength) and the initial slope was taken as equal to 0.1. A total of 30 bars were used and represented\\nby Steel02 material [58], with the properties shown in Table 3 and the ratio between the post-yield\\ntangent and initial elastic tangent equal to 0.01 (Figure 8). The parameters that control the transition\\nfrom elastic to plastic branches were assumed R0 = 15, CR1 = 0.925 and CR2 = 0.15, as suggested\\nby [53]. The masonry walls were modelled as equivalent diagonal elasticBeamColumn elements [52,53],\\nin both the longitudinal and transversal directions. The masonry walls’ properties were selected based\\non the Italian code provisions, with low-to-medium mechanical characteristics (Table C8A.2.1 [59]),\\nas shown in Table 4. Table 5 shows the vibration periods of the structure with and without the inﬁll\\nmasonry walls. It is worth noting that the masonry walls aﬀect the structural natural period (from\\n0.3012 s to 0.2085 s), since they increase the lateral stiﬀness of the whole structure (as shown in [60]).\\nIn particular, the inﬁll masonry walls introduce diﬀerent mechanisms that may signiﬁcantly modify the\\nseismic behavior of the structure. The foundation was modelled as a 0.50-m-deep rectangular concrete\\nraft foundation (28.4 m × 34.4 m) in order to represent the recurring shallow foundation typologies for\\nresidential buildings. These types of foundation can be particularly vulnerable due to their bearing\\ncapacity, which depends only on the contact pressure and not on the frictional mechanisms (as in\\nthe case of deep foundations). The considered foundation was assumed to be rigid, by tying all the\\ncolumns base nodes together with those of the soil domain surface, using equalDOF [52,53]. Horizontal\\nrigid beam-column links were set normal to the column longitudinal axis to simulate the interface\\nbetween the column and the foundation. The foundation was designed by calculating the eccentricity\\n(the ratio between the overturning bending moment at the foundation level and the vertical forces)\\nin the most detrimental condition of the minimum vertical loads (gravity and seismic loads) and\\nmaximum bending moments. The foundation was modelled with an equivalent concrete material, by\\napplying the Pressure Independent Multi-Yield model [52,53] (Table 6). This model consists of a non-linear\\nhysteretic material with a Von Mises multi-surface kinematic plasticity model, which can simulate\\na monotonic or cyclic response of materials whose shear behavior is insensitive to the conﬁnement\\nchange. The nonlinear shear stress-strain backbone curve is represented by the hyperbolic relation,\\ndeﬁned by the two material constants (low-strain shear modulus and ultimate shear strength) [52,53].\\n</td>\n",

Furthermore, the reviewed topic has persisted for about a decade. However, two serious\\nbiases are found. First, the number of published works remains restricted (Figure 1), which means\\nthat each principal topic is covered by a limited number of publications (Table 2). One would expect\\nmore frequent analysis of geoheritage and climbing due to their natural concurrence. Second, there is\\na large geographical bias because of the limited global dispersal of the reviewed research (Figure 2).\\nThe information is absent from many mountainous domains of the world, including the Andes,\\nthe Himalaya, and many other mountain chains of the Americas, Africa, Australia, and even Europe.\\nIt is impossible to believe that their rich geoheritage occurs where climbers are absent, and vice versa.\\nThe critical consideration of the research on geoheritage and climbing activities allows the\\nidentiﬁcation of some important research gaps to be ﬁlled by further investigation. First, the majority of\\nthe reviewed sources reﬂect a “positivist” view, which generally considers geoconservation/geotourism\\nand climbing as mutually important activities. Environmental concerns and safety concerns also exist,\\nbut these research lines are less important. Apparently, too little is still known about geoheritage\\ndamage and loss at climbing sites, as well as about the challenges for climbers linked to geoheritage\\nestablishment. Second, there is only weak evidence of the climbers’ interest in geoheritage, geoeducation,\\nand geoconservation. Similarly, it is unclear how many geotourists are ready for a climbing experience,\\neven if minimal and the simplest. In other words, any successful relationship between geoheritage\\nand climbing activities requires curiosity and education demand from climbers, and physical training\\nand certain risk-taking by geotourists. Third, the available research does not provide evidence of\\nhow “ordinary” geotourists and professional climbers may tolerate each other. One may hypothesize\\nthat the concentration of climbers will make a given geosite less attractive to geotourists due to\\napparent diﬃculty of routes, and crowding by geotourists will distract climbers (it would be diﬃcult\\nto feel like an outstanding peak conqueror while surrounded by dozens of “just tourists”). Fourth,\\nmore attention should be paid to geoparks. These establishments serve geotourists (sensu stricto)\\nand many other types of tourists, and these may be essential for joint development of geoheritage\\nmanagement, geotourism, and climbing activities. Although some reviewed sources focus on geoparks\\n(Table 1), the wide international networks of the latter [7,23,24,29] oﬀer more opportunities for analysis\\nof the above-mentioned joint development. Fifth, the geographical focus of the reviewed research\\ndirection is centered on continents or big islands (Table 1, Figure 2). However, the example of the\\nAzores [118] indicates that small islands can be important geoheritage localities oﬀering various\\nopportunities for climbing activities. It should be also noted that many oceanic islands are often\\nstressed by tsunamis, extreme storms, and super-typhoons, with megaclasts a signature feature (e.g., see\\nreview in [80]).

The authors relate this\\ndeepening of the depositional environment with the Late Cretaceous–Paleogene abortive rifting that\\noccurred in Adria, in analogy with that observed from Libya to southern Sicily [49]. A similar margin to\\nslope succession characterizes the Mt Croce unit. It starts with Upper Cretaceous–Paleocene calcareous\\nbreccias, corresponding to the Calcari Cristallini Fm, a widespread recrystallized calcareous clastic\\ndeposit, marking the start of the platform sinking in several places of the southern Apennines [7,8,49].\\nThe succession passes upward to a thick, scaglia-type slope calciclastics deposit and basin calcilutites,\\nmarls, and argillites. The succession ends with Serravallian foredeep sandstones corresponding to the\\nsimilar sediments in the Laviano area. Finally, unconformable deposits of the upper Tortonian–lower\\nMessinian CVTG cover both successions. This close analogy suggests a similar paleogeographic\\nposition in the uppermost Cretaceous, where they formed the eastern margin of the Apennine Platform.\\nFurthermore, both margin successions were involved in the same out-of-sequence thrusting event [11].\\nThe structural analysis presented in the previous paragraphs gives us some inputs to propose a\\npossible reconstruction of the tectonic events of this key sector of the southern Apennines. The best place\\nto observe the superposition between the diﬀerent orogenic stages is the Salitto outcrop (Campagna\\ntectonic window). Here, we have recognized the superposition of ﬁve deformation stages in the footwall\\nof the out-of-sequence thrust, which juxtaposes the Frigento unit onto the Mt Croce unit, with the\\ninterposition of the CVTG rocks. The ﬁrst (D1) includes regional thrusts and minor mesoscale thrusts\\nwith related folds, all deﬁned by a vergence to the E/SE. This in-sequence thrusting event allowed\\nthe tectonic covering of the Apennine Platform rocks (Picentini Mts unit) onto the Lagonegro-Molise\\nBasin deposits (Frigento unit). The second stage (D2) was recorded by normal faults, deformed by\\nthe subsequent shortening deformations. As suggested by [11,31], we associate this extensional event\\nwith the formation of several structural depressions where the CVTG sediments were deposited.\\nA synorogenic extensional environment was also envisaged for the older Langhian–lower Tortonian\\nwedge-top basin deposits of the Cilento Group [27,28,31]. A recent study [50] in the Cilento area\\n(Figure 1a) about temperature-dependent clay minerals and vitrinite reﬂectance in the Cilento Group\\nand Mt Sacro Fm (CVTG) indicates a basin evolution marked by two phases of severe subsidence,\\ninterpreted as the result of syn-orogenic extension at shallow crustal levels. Hence, this extensional\\nevent occurred in the southern Apennines with the deposition of CVTG sediments within structurally\\ncontrolled depocenters. Furthermore, in several outcrops of the southern Apennines, including those\\nlocalized in the Campagna tectonic window, the base of CVTG deposits is marked by carbonate\\nconglomerates with an arenaceous matrix [14,15,40,51–53]. This feature could mark the erosion of\\ncarbonates placed in the footwall of the D2 normal faults.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>One of the most intriguing findings uncovered in the study is the high negative correlation between\\npixel-pair soil moisture time series and distance (i.e. high inter-pixel cross-correlation dependency on\\ndistance) of the ACTIVE soil moisture product. Further, the ACTIVE product exhibits a high average\\nstudy domain wide inter-pixel soil moisture time series cross-correlation, which in itself is suspicious\\nwhen considering that neighbouring pixels even with very different soil/vegetation type distributions\\ncorrelate to a high degree with each other. Some correlation is of course expected since top soil\\nmoisture, in particular, is heavily inﬂuenced by precipitation, but for this to occur with neighbouring\\ncells with very different soil/vegetation type distributions is suspicious. In fact, the ACTIVE product’s\\ninter-pixel soil moisture cross-correlation dependency on distance resembles that of precipitation.\\nTherefore, it is possible, and even reasonable, to suspect that the ESA CCI ACTIVE soil moisture\\nproduct actually represents moisture changes in vegetation, tree canopies, and so on. Many other\\nprevious studies (e.g., [22,23]) have also come to similar conclusions. The exclusion of the ACTIVE\\nproduct, for most pixels during the latter years of the analysis period, in producing the COMBINED\\nproduct is therefore reasonable. However, there might be other additional reasons for the exclusion of\\nthe ACTIVE product in the COMBINED product, which are not investigated as part of this study. In\\ncontrast, the PASSIVE and SAC-SMA models exhibit a fairly low negative inter-pixel soil moisture\\ncross-correlation dependency on distance. The ESA CCI PASSIVE soil moisture product correlates\\nwell with pixels containing large organic soil fractions. Organic soils (bogs) tend to react slowly to\\nprecipitation and represent soil moisture change as a smooth trend. Since organic soils represent a\\ntrend, correlation to this is as a positive thing. The PASSIVE product also exhibits poor correlation\\nwith pixels containing large fractions of shallow soils, i.e., rapidly responding type soils. This suggests\\nthat the ESA CCI PASIIVE product is able to, in most cases, capture the temporal trend in soil moisture\\nvariation. However, although the trend is seemingly captured, the rapid response to precipitation\\nevents is less accurate. With the ACTIVE product, although there is a very signiﬁcant dependency on\\nshallow soils fraction size to SAC-SMA model correlation, there is no other statistically signiﬁcant\\nsoil/vegetation type predictor that explains ESA CCI ACTIVE SM product performance. This and the\\nhigh degree of inter-pixel, distance-based spatial association are strong indicators that the ACTIVE\\nproduct’s soil moisture ﬂuctuations are largely unresponsive to changes in soil types between the\\npixels. It should, however, be noted that the relatively large measurement footprints, with magnitudes\\nof tens of kilometres, of both the ACTIVE and PASSIVE soil moisture retrieval sensors used to derive\\nthe ESA CCI SM products, may be partly to blame for the high inter-pixel distance-based spatial\\nassociations found in our study. In particular, this is relevant when considering that the ESA CCI SM\\nproduct pixels are in comparison relatively small at only 26 by 10 km. Further studies focusing on\\ninter-pixel distance-based spatial association should be conducted with the original EO-datasets used\\nto derive the ESA CCI SM products and with a much larger study domain.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Abstract: This paper describes selected results from over a dozen collaborative projects led by\\nCommonwealth Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia spanning\\na 30-year history of developments in satellite, airborne, ﬁeld and drill core sensing technologies and\\nhow these can assist explorers to measure and map valuable mineral information. The exploration\\ncase histories are largely from Australian test sites and describe how spectral sensing technologies\\nhave progressed from early “niche creation” systems, such as the ﬁeld PIMA-II (Portable Field\\nMineral Analyzer) and airborne Geoscan, HyMap™ and OARS-TIPS (Operational Airborne Remote\\nSensing – Thermal Infrared Proﬁling Spectrometer) systems and drill-core HyLogger™ systems,\\nto the current expanding array of pubic and commercial mineral mapping sensors, including the\\nASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂectance Radiometer) satellite system which\\nhas acquired imagery spanning the entire Earth’s land surface (&lt;83◦ latitude). These sensors are\\ndelivering voluminous spectral data from different parts of the visible to the thermal infrared (400 to\\n14,000 nm) spectrum at different spectral, radiometric and spatial resolutions. Two critical exploration\\nchallenges are central to the case histories, namely: (i) can surface cover, such as vegetation, regolith\\nor transported materials, be characterized and accounted for so that the target geology is accurately\\nrevealed; and (ii) does this revealed geology show evidence of alteration footprints to potential\\neconomic mineralization. Spectrally measurable minerals important to solving these challenges\\ninclude white micas, kaolinite and garnets, with measurement of their respective physicochemistries\\nbeing key. For example, kaolin disorder is useful for mapping transported versus weathered in situ\\nmaterials, while the chemical substitution in white micas and garnets provide vectors to potential\\neconomic mineralization. Importantly, appropriate selection of the optimum sensor/data type for\\na given geological application depends primarily on the level of detail/accuracy of the mineral\\ninformation required by the user. A major opportunity is to now harness the many sensor/data\\ntypes and deliver to users consistent, accurate mineral information products, that is, creation of\\na number of valuable global mineral product standards. As part of this vision, CSIRO has been\\ndeveloping improved sensor/data calibration processes and information extraction methods that for\\nexample, unmix the target mineralogy from green and dry vegetation cover in remote sensing data\\nsets. Emphasis to date has been on generating public spectral-mineral product standards, especially at\\nASTER’s limited but geologically-valuable spectral resolution. The results are showing that scalable,\\nglobal, three-dimensional (3D) mineral maps are achievable which will only improve our ability\\nto more accurately characterize regolith and geological architecture, increase our understanding of\\nformative processes and assist the discovery of new economic mineral systems.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Tsigrado samples yielded sufﬁcient expansions and for each sample we calculated mass loss\\nderived from the removal of drops, as well as from water volatilisation (Table S2, see online\\nSupplementary Materials). After subtraction of these losses from the estimated total mass loss, there is\\nstill a considerable amount of missing material (ranging from 4.0 to 6.8 wt %), and it is plausible to\\nassume that it escaped to the atmosphere mainly during thermal treatment or perhaps as ﬁne material\\nduring sample collection, as well. Of the major elements, none (except LOI) can be considered to\\nbe volatile at perlite treatment temperatures; therefore, it is unlikely to involve volatilisation of a\\nmajor compound other than that of crystalline water. The composition of minerals released from the\\nexpanded perlite is reﬂected in the elemental losses from the expanded material relative to its crude\\nparent sample (Table S1). Isocon analysis revealed that a group of elements show consistent losses\\nabove the measured total mass loss of the CCP, which suggests that they escaped preferentially in\\nthe drops; hence, their behaviour can be explained by their selective partitioning in crystals rather\\nthan the groundmass. The elements of the second group that show losses similar to the total mass loss\\nare considered to be partitioned equally in the groundmass (which mostly remained in the expanded\\nmaterial or secondarily escaped as airborne particles) and the crystals (that escaped mostly as drops).\\nElements that show losses less than the total mass loss indicate their strong connection with the\\ngroundmass; hence, their losses may be related only to the escape of airborne particles from the system.\\nLOI diminishes signiﬁcantly after expansion (Figure 4, Table S1), presumably because of the loss\\nof combined water, which is the main factor that reinforces perlite expansion. Eu and Sr substitute\\nreadily for Ca in the plagioclase structure [19,20]; therefore, their consistent losses reﬂect the prominent\\nremoval of plagioclases in the drops. Losses of Fe2O3 and TiO2 are associated with the removal of\\nilmenite and biotite from the expanded perlite sample. The loss of Ta is also connected with the\\nremoval of ilmenite from the Tsigrado expanded perlite sample, since this high ﬁeld strength element\\nis known to participate in the structure of Fe–Ti phases [21]. MgO loss from the expanded perlite\\nsample is consistent with the removal of biotite in drops during expansion, whereas the depletion of\\nlimited spinel may also contribute to MgO loss. Losses of Zr are related to zircon removal, whereas the\\nlosses of Pb (and Cu, which, however, can participate in other sulphides too) reﬂect the removal of\\ngalena from the expanded perlite. Tl loss may be assigned to the removal of K-feldspars and micas\\nafter expansion, since it is known to participate in these mineral structures [22,23]; however, limited\\nK, Rb and Ba losses do not substantiate that K-feldspar escape was prominent (see below). Tl and\\nPb are very volatile elements [24] and perlite treatment temperatures are in the range of their 50%\\ncondensation temperature, which strongly suggests that signiﬁcant amounts of these elements are\\nvolatilised partially and escape in the atmosphere.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>FTIR spectrum is often used to characterize the structure and coordinative sites of clay-based\\nminerals. Many typical vibration bands can be found on IR spectra of different clay minerals, while\\nthe spectra of halloysite in the range 550~1350 cm−1 are similar to kaolinite [53], so the ascriptions\\nare often difﬁcult to be recognized, but they still have some distinctive bands. Each vibration line\\nis assigned to the stretching or deformation of the groups and bonds in the samples according\\nto the literature [48,54–57]; the FTIR spectra of Hal from different regions are shown in Figure 2\\nand the ascriptions are included in Table 2, respectively. The double adsorption bands at around\\n3696 cm−1 and 3620 cm−1 were ascribed to the stretching vibration of the adsorbed water. The peaks\\nat 3696 cm−1 corresponded to the stretching of perpendicular surface –OH groups, and the band at\\naround 3620 cm−1 is ascribed to the stretching of –OH coordinated with the tetrahedral sheet and\\noctahedral sheet located in the unit cell of Hal structural. The peak at 1642~1650 cm−1 could be\\nascribed to the bending of –OH in adsorbed water (for better recognition of the typical IR bands in\\nthe range 400~1200 cm−1, the spectra in the range 1200~3000 cm−1 were not shown for clarity of the\\nfringes in mid-infrared part). The intensity of the H–O–H deformation band at 1642 cm−1 increased\\nwith decreasing degree of structural order, and the band increased with the increasing of inter-layer\\nwater contents. The broad bands in the range adsorption band at 950~1150 cm−1 originated from\\nthe Si–O stretching vibrations in all kinds of silicate-based clay minerals. The main absorption was\\ndetected at 1030 cm−1, with a trace of shoulder at around 1010 cm−1, which were often ascribed to\\nthe asymmetric in-plane Si–O–Si stretching. The same in-plane stretching of apical Si–O bonds were\\ndetected at 1094 cm−1. Furthermore, the symmetric stretching of Si–O bonds involving the basal\\noxygen atoms can be observed at 1116 cm−1. All of the Si–O stretching bands are similar for the Hal\\nsamples, with the exception of Hal-SY sample, which illustrated a relatively stronger band at 1116\\ncm−1, conﬁrming that the Hal-SY sample should have more fragments or imperfections in the lattice.\\nThis has been and will be further veriﬁed in the following characterizations. The adsorption peak at\\naround 910 cm−1 could be ascribed to the –OH deformation of inner hydroxyls [58], which illustrated\\na small shift to the higher wavenumber position (913 cm−1) for Hal-SY sample, indicating the different\\nhydration state of this sample. The spectral bands from 690~800 cm−1 could be designated to the\\nstretching of the Si–O lattice. The symmetric stretching was detected at 793 cm−1, and the doublet\\nbands observed at 756 cm−1 and 695 cm−1 originated from the perpendicular stretching of Si–O bonds\\nprobably involving to surface hydroxyls. The double adsorption peaks at 534 cm−1 and 468 cm−1 were\\nascribed to the bending vibration of the Si–O groups. The former should result from the deformation\\nof Al–O–Si frames, and the latter should have originated from the deformation of Si–O–Si bonds. The\\nsmall bands at 432 cm−1 and 418 cm−1 should also come from the stretching of Si–O bonds in [SiO4]\\ntetrahedral frameworks. The FTIR spectra of the different Hal showed nearly similar shapes with very\\nlittle deviations, only the Hal-SY has some tiny differences in the positions or relative intensities of\\nthe vibration bands, which conﬁrms that the acquired Hal minerals has the same basic structures, but\\nremains to have some differences in the individual samples.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>It is very important to notice the similarity between block and sublevel caving. In block caving,\\nhigh ore columns are being caved, and the drawing of caved material takes place at the bottom of\\nthe block. During this process, caved rock fragments are subjected to the gravity ﬂow, and their size\\nis changed as a function of the length of the distance traveled. Proper design of the drawing points\\ninside the block caving mines requires proper determination of the secondary rock fragmentation\\nin order to avoid the draw point jamming and loss. The key point here is to notice that during the\\ncaving and gravity ﬂow of the broken rock, the size of the rock fragments is changed, as well as the\\nfrictional properties of their surfaces. Secondary fragmentation in block caving is identiﬁed as one\\nof the most inﬂuential parameters on gravity ﬂow formation [41–43]. While in block caving mines,\\ncaved rock mass is subjected to the gravity ﬂow inside the geometry of one column, and this takes\\nplace until the production is ﬁnished, the sublevel caving mines situation is slightly different. Ore is\\nblasted and loaded from the sublevel drifts in slices that advance along the sublevel drift. During the\\nore loading, the gravity ﬂow of broken ore and caved waste material is formed, and after the ﬁnishing\\nof the production at one sublevel, production continues at the next, lower one. In this manner, caved\\nrock mass is traveling just in smaller portions, but in the end, it is subjected to the same process as\\nthe caved mass in block caving mines. This means that upper sublevels will face the caved waste\\nrock that has coarser fragmentation, while lower sublevels will have different states of the caved rock\\nmass, which has ﬁner fragmentation and different frictional properties. During the gravity ﬂow, those\\nrock blocks are rubbed against each other, and their surfaces become smoother; their friction angle\\nis closer to the basic friction angle [44] for that rock type. This means that those rock fragments will\\nhave smaller kinematic resistance and may easily come to the loading point and mix with the ore,\\nproducing its dilution. These changes are illustrated in Figure 2. However, friction and the size of the\\nrock fragments are changed simultaneously, and those changes should be analyzed together. The real\\nsituation in sublevel mines depends on the actual geological conditions that are present in a certain\\nmine. Primary block sizes and their frictional properties are determined by the jointing of the rock\\nmass. This should be the starting point for the research of sublevel gravity ﬂow. It is well known that\\nrock mass that is caved is subjected to the tensile failure, and the surfaces of the rock blocks that are\\ncreated in this manner are very rough [45–47]. However, other surfaces of the caved rock fragments\\nare determined by the quality of the joint walls that created those surfaces. This means that on some\\noccasions, those surfaces may have a lower friction angle than the basic friction angle. Due to the\\n</td>\n",

In deep-marine\\nenvironments, volcanic ashes are precursor materials of bentonites, and thus bentonites have\\na diagenetic origin rather than a sedimentary origin.\\nIn this environment, the K, Ca and Mg\\nare readily available and used for the formation of smectite and illite, thus the ash beds are mainly\\ncomposed of smectite in the early stage and subsequently dominated by illite due to the illitization\\nof smectite [50,51]. Although the mineralogy and chemistry of the clay minerals that form could be\\ninﬂuenced by the variations of burial conditions, the volcanic ash is usually altered into smectite in\\nsubaqueous environments [49,52,53]. In this study, the clay minerals mainly consist of illite (86%),\\nwith minor R3 ordering illite/smectite (13%), and chlorite (1%). The clay minerals of Li-rich clays\\nsample TL-1 and TL-2 from Tongliang section completely comprise I/S, while the sample TL-3 is\\nmainly composed of R3 ordered I/S (68%), illite (24%) and chlorite (5%) [2]. Generally, the I/S in\\nK-bentonite is considered to alter from the smectite during diagenesis, whereas smectite is mainly\\nformed by submarine alteration of volcanic materials [52,54]. The illitization of smectite begins at\\nabout 70~80\\nC and leads to a decrease in the percentage of smectite in this process, which is usually\\ncharacterized by the following reaction sequence: smectite→randomly interstratiﬁed illite-smectite\\nmixed layer (I-S)→ordered I-S→illite [55,56]. Although the composition and permeability of the parent\\nash seems to be the principal controlling factor in the illitization rates of smectite, it appears that other\\nimportant factors could have inﬂuenced the reaction, such as the burial temperature and time, as well\\nas the chemistry of porewaters (especially K+ content) [56,57]. The characteristics of mixed layer I/S\\nclay minerals are signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the deposition facies and porewater K concentrations [58].\\nThe mixed-layer R3 ordered I/S derived from the smectite illitization of a volcanic ash bed observed in\\nthis study is probably attributed to deep burial and elevated alteration temperatures [59,60], while\\nthe poorly ordered (R0) mixed-layered I/S is usually attributed to a low burial temperature [61].\\nThe temperatures and depth of post-sedimentary alteration reached by the sediments during the\\nburial diagenesis history could be reliably estimated by the proportion of smectite layers in I/S [58].\\nThe percent of smectite in I/S of the Li-rich K-bentonite is around 15%, suggesting that the temperatures\\nof thermal evolution reached by the sediments are approximately 180\\nC [55,62]. Based on the\\nC/km in the Sichuan basin, the burial depth\\nassumption of an average geothermal gradient of 30\\ncalculated for the Early–Middle Triassic Li-rich K-bentonites corresponds to around 6 km. The Eu/Eu*\\nvalues of eruptive volcanic ashes are initially dependent on the growth of magmatic plagioclase, and the\\nEu generally tends not to fractionate relative to other REEs during the transport and deposition, except\\nthat it can easily be changed in a reducing diagenetic environment. The Eu anomaly, therefore, may\\nbe used as a robust proxy to indicate source-magma chemistry [63–65].

The hydro-stratigraphy of the basin includes\\nmany of the units described by the Northwest Institute of Uranium Geology [22]. The Proterozoic and\\nCarboniferous stratigraphic units comprise the lower aquifer. Those units are complexly fractured and\\nthe fractures are believed to have enhanced hydraulic connectivity. Much of the Mesozoic stratigraphy\\nforms a regional sandstone aquifer. Jurassic mudstone and coal stratigraphy may locally be aquifers,\\nbut generally form barriers and aquitards to groundwater ﬂow. Uppermost Tertiary and Quaternary\\nalluvial basin-ﬁll deposits comprise the regional basin-ﬁll aquifer. Groundwater ﬂow in the regional\\nsandstone and basin-ﬁll aquifers is commonly hydrologically connected throughout much of the\\nsouthwestern Tuha basin. Most of the recharge for the regional aquifer is from the mountainous\\nregions south of the basin and, partially, from snowmelt water on the Bogeda Mountain in the north\\nof the basin [22]. The Jiaoluotage Mountain range along the southern margin of the basin produces\\nsufﬁcient moisture for groundwater recharge to occur in the basin. The climate across the Tuha basin is\\narid with a mean annual precipitation of approximately 17 mm. The annual evapotranspiration there,\\nhowever, is more than 3000 mm. The mean annual temperature is 13.9 ˝C and the highest temperature\\nin the summer reaches 50 ˝C, the highest temperature in China. Given the low precipitation to\\nevapotranspiration ratio, recharge into the aquifer from direct inﬁltration of rainfall precipitation is\\nsmall. Discharge of groundwater occurs primarily through natural springs and Lake Aiting. Most of\\nthe larger discharge springs emanate from either the Carboniferous intermediate-acidic volcanic and\\nvolcaniclastic rocks (Spring 2 or sample 2, Table 1) around the margin of the basin or from Quaternary\\nrocks within the basin (Spring 1 or sample 1).

Polymorphic layers\\nare comprised of clay minerals, residual organic material, bacterial cells, and secondary Au structures.\\nThese layers often occur within crevices, which is to say, topographically-low regions, at the surface of\\nAu particles [64,66,67,78]. Secondary Au structures are nanometer–micrometer-scale features that occur\\non Au particles. With increasing sophistication of electron microscopes, the characterization of these\\nsecondary Au structures has greatly improved, thereby providing a better understanding of Au-particle\\ntransformation. Secondary Au structures can be broadly categorized into two groups, based on the\\nprocesses that contribute to their formation: Au/Ag dissolution and Au reprecipitation. It is the\\nbalance between these two, biogeochemical processes that drives the cycling of Au and contributes to\\nthe transformation of Au particles. The solubilization of Au and Ag from Au particles (for example,\\nby dealloying or (bacterially-catalyzed) solubilization) leads to the formation of dissolution features\\nwhich include striations, porous structures, and bacteriomorphic Au [62,66,67,77,79,80]. These features\\nare attributed to (bio)geochemical-dissolution processes, as striations often occur along Au crystal\\nboundaries [80]. Bacteriomorphic Au also contains a crystalline fabric, containing both Au and\\nAg, which is reminiscent of the primary material [66]. As previously mentioned, dissolved Au\\noccurs as soluble-Au complexes that can be directly reduced by bacteria or other organic/inorganic\\nreductants, to form pure, Au0 nanoparticles. While these nanoparticles often appear quasi-spherical\\nin shape, they are actually nanophase crystals. At micrometer-scales, euhedral crystals are more\\nclearly-deﬁned and variability in structures is apparent, as shown in Figure 2. It is important to keep\\nin mind that Au-dissolution processes, acting on a Au particle, can also act upon Au nanoparticles,\\nthereby increasing structural variability. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that, with increased\\nAu solubilization from an Au particle, subsequent reduction of the soluble complex will either form\\nmore abundant nanoparticles or allow nanoparticles to grow in size. Additionally, secondary Au\\nstructures can be physically altered during mechanical re-shaping, which suggests a balance between\\n(bio)geochemical and mechanical weathering processes. Therefore, secondary Au structures are\\nrelicts—physical evidence of past, biogeochemical processes that have transformed particle surfaces\\nand have attributed, in part, to the activity of microbes [61,66,67,77,81], as shown in Figure 3.\\nInterestingly, Au particles that exhibited a greater extent of transformation also contained bioﬁlms\\nwith a more-specialized, metal-tolerant, microbial community [61,67]. Though Au is conventionally\\nconsidered an inert metal, the interaction between microbes and Au particles highlights not only an\\ninﬂuence of bacteria on Au-particle-structure and chemistry, but on microbial diversity as well, with\\nregards increased resistance to Au toxicity.\\n</td>\n",

An exception from this is the precipitation response to HS2. HS2 is almost\\nas pronounced as HS1 in the 231Pa/230Th record (Figure 6b) and should have caused a distinct\\nprecipitation response in WA. However, precipitation changes are modest at the beginning of HS2\\nand peak at its termination, shortly before the AMOC returns from its off-mode into its cold-mode\\n(Figure 6d–f). What is also evident in the δ18O time series from Pacupahuain Cave is the increasing\\nprecipitation associated with the evolution of DO12. This pattern is less clearly pronounced in the two\\nδ18O time series from El Condor Cave (Figure 6d) and absent in the record from Cueva del Diamate\\n(Figure 6e). The latter is likely caused by the low temporal resolution of this record at the time of\\nDO12 (Figure 6e). During MIS 3 similar responses as for the WA δ18O time series are observed for\\neastern Amazonia (Figure 6g), eastern Brazil (Figure 6h), and northeastern Brazil (Figure 6i).

       "      <td>The coherent response in central, eastern and northeastern Brazil during HS1 is termed the\\nMega-SACZ [25]. The response in rainfall amount during MIS 3 across the SAMS domain suggests\\nthat the development of a Mega-SACZ is not only restricted to HS1 but is present and even more\\npronounced during all Heinrich stadials in MIS 3. Moreover, the speleothem and travertine growth\\nperiods from northeastern Brazil, dating back 220 kyrs, suggest the development of the Mega-SACZ\\nbefore the Eemian (MIS 5e, c. 130 kyrs BP to 115 kyrs BP) [45]. Testing this hypothesis requires\\nthe generation of new high-resolution (&lt;30 years) speleothem δ18O time series covering the last\\n120 kyrs from the region. Strengthening of the cross-equatorial heat transport, related to changes\\nin sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical Atlantic, are thought to drive the development\\nof the Mega-SACZ [25]. This is consistent with modelling experiments investigating the effect of\\na mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere cooling through an AMOC shutdown, which would drive\\nchanges in SSTs in the tropical Atlantic [47]. Chiang and others (2012) [47] suggest dry conditions\\nshould prevail in northeast Brazil during an AMOC shutdown, however, this is not consistent with\\nthe speleothem-based rainfall reconstructions presented discussed here (Figure 6j). It is not clear why\\nmodelling and the palaeoclimate reconstructions exhibit opposite precipitation trends in response to\\nHeinrich stadials (NH cooling); further work is necessary to resolve this apparent discrepancy between\\nmodels and observations, and highlights Nordeste as a key region for data-model comparisons.\\nCompared to the precipitation response during Heinrich and DO stadials in MIS 3, the precipitation\\nvariability during HS1 is different in the domain of the SAMS (Figure 6). This is particulary the\\ncase in western Amazonia where precipitation amounts progressively decrease (Figure 6e,f) while\\nprecipitation amounts in the other regions increase; except eastern Amazonia, where no speleothem\\nδ18O time series is available. Kanner et al. (2012) [27] noted an inﬂunce of Southern Hemisphere (SH)\\nhigh latitude climate variability on precipitation changes at Pacupahuain Cave during the Antarctic\\nIsotope Maxima 8 (40 to 37 kyrs BP) and 12 (48.5 to 46 kyrs BP). A similar high-latitude inﬂuence on\\nprecipitation amounts in the northern realm of the SAMS domain could also explain the apparent\\ndifferences between the WA speleothem δ18O time series and the other Brazilian δ18O time series. With\\nthe beginning of HS1 in the NH, reconstructed Antarctic temperaures increase until about 14 kyrs\\nBP [48]. Therefore, the opposite hemispheric temperature trends, a cooling NH associated with HS1\\nand a warming SH, strengthened the inter-hemispheric temperature contrast, which, based on energetic\\nconstrains [1,44,47], provokes a southward shift of the ITCZ (similar to the arguments in Section 3.1.1),\\nin turn, shifting and/or tilting SAMS precipitation pattern. This would causes a precipitation decrease\\nin western Amazonia. In summary, the precipitation variability of the SAMS from 50 kyrs BP until\\nthe end of the YD is heavily dependent on the high-latitude NH climate variablity associated with\\nNH cold events (Heinrich stadials) and DOs, respectively. The emerging pattern during MIS 3 is that\\nprecipitation amounts were higher during NH cold events compared to DOs. Modest precipitation\\nchanges are observed during HS2 and this is unexpected when considering the observed precipitation\\nincrease to HS in MIS 3. However, one explaination for this can be, that HS2 is not followed by a DO,\\nwhile all other NH cold events in MIS 3 are followed by a DO (Figure 6a–c). This may have weakened\\nthe response of the SAMS and precipitation changes to HS.\\n</td>\n",

The region spans the transition between a temperate\\nMediterranean climate in the Levant to hyper-arid sub-tropical deserts in the south, with complex\\nalpine topography in the northeast feeding the Euphrates and Tigris rivers which support life in the\\nSoutheastern FC (Figure 1). Climate projections predict severe drying in major parts of the ME in\\nresponse to global climate change, with a considerable impact for societies [3–5]. Climate reconstructions\\nand archaeological information, suggest that changes in the regional hydroclimate was a primary driver\\nin human expansion out of Africa [6], the Neolithic revolution, and the development of the ﬁrst complex\\nsocieties [7]. The ME has plentiful archeological records of human settlement throughout much of\\nthe Quaternary, and well into the Holocene [8–14]. Initially, the predominantly semi to hyper-arid\\nclimate of the region served as a bottle-neck for early hominin dispersion out of Africa, allowing\\nmigrations onto the Levant and the AP pathways only during wetter periods that were identiﬁed\\nusing speleothem growth (wet)/non-growth (dry) patterns in desert and water-limited settings [15–18].\\nThese events are also recognized using other methods and diﬀerent climate archives [10,19,20]. Since\\nthe Last Glacial Maximum from c. 25 to 20 ka BP (Before Present, calibrated in the SISAL database\\nto the year 1950 of the Common Era, hereafter CE) and the following transition into the Holocene\\ninterglacial, there has been considerable evidence that variations in climate served as a driver in\\nHomo Sapiens’ cultural evolution. The most notable is the “Neolithic Revolution”, where it has been\\nsuggested that post-glacial hunter-gatherers were able to cultivate a number of food plants due to the\\ntrend towards warmer and possibly wetter climate [21], whereas succeeding abrupt cooling events\\nmay have forced proto-agrarian societies to turn to the cultivation of wild cereals and fruit [21–23].\\nWheat was cultivated in the FC around 9500 years BP, suggesting that the ME was the ﬁrst region to\\ncultivate plants and support sedentary human communities [24,25]. The ME localities, speciﬁcally the\\nFC, were also the earliest locations where sophisticated civilizations, city-states and complex empire\\nsystems appeared during the mid- to late-Holocene [26,27]. It has been argued that the expansion and\\nsubsequent collapse of these civilizations was partly driven by rapid climate change events [14,28–32]\\nsuperimposed on more gradual millennial climatic shifts. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested\\nan association between a contemporary increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts in recent\\ndecades, to geopolitical unrest in the region, e.g., the Syrian Civil War [29,33,34]. These correlations\\nhighlight the importance of understanding both past and future climate perturbations in the ME.\\nThis can be achieved by use of large spatio-temporal networks/datasets of terrestrial hydro-climate\\narchives. Regional-scale coherency would greatly improve our understanding of past variations in the\\nspatio-temporal precipitation pattern of the ME, thereby resolving some of the contradictions between\\ndiﬀerent records in the region [1,35].\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Chinese speleothem δ18O records have substantially improved our understanding of the EASM\\nvariability on diﬀerent timescales. However, the paleoclimatic interpretation of Chinese speleothem\\nδ18O records remains an issue of debate [16,181–193]. For example, there is a strong correlation\\nbetween speleothem δ18O series in the EASM and ISM regions, but these data contrast with some\\nother Chinese rainfall records reconstructed by loess and lake sediments [181,182,188]. A few studies\\nsuggest that Chinese speleothem δ18O variability is not controlled by rainfall amount but by moisture\\nsource [181,182] or pathway [192], while others conclude that they are not only inﬂuenced by the EASM\\nbut also to a signiﬁcant extent by winter temperature [184,185]. Instrumental data and paleoclimatic\\nreconstructions based on other natural archives imply a spatial distribution of rainfall over eastern\\nChina that is not consistent with the observations from speleothem δ18O records. In this regard,\\nLiu et al. [189] argued that speleothem δ18O records in the region cannot be used as an indicator of\\nEASM intensity. These disagreements partially arose from diﬀering deﬁnitions of “ASM intensity”.\\nChinese speleothem δ18O records, particularly on orbital to millennial scales, reﬂect ﬁrst order changes\\nin the fraction of water vapor rained out between tropical sources and cave sites (e.g., [1,12,50]). By this\\ndeﬁnition, a strong ASM implies a more remote moisture source, with larger rainout along the moisture\\ntrajectory, and thus lighter speleothem δ18O values (e.g., [12]). On orbital scales, this observation is\\nreproducible because Chinese speleothem records follow the NHSI, but their relation to regional rainfall\\namount remains in dispute [181,182,188,189,193]. Regarding large millennial-scale events, speleothem\\nδ18O records show consistent positive excursions (i.e., weak EASM) corresponding to cold events\\nthat occurred in NH high latitudes. However, the associated spatial changes in rainfall in the EASM\\ndomain could have some regional diﬀerences, as suggested by model simulations (e.g., [186,194,195]),\\nand as of yet, very limited and diﬃcult to interpret observational data (e.g., [14,196]). The spatial\\ndistribution of rainfall in monsoonal China is primarily controlled by changes in the position of the\\nmonsoonal rainfall belt in response to changes in EASM intensity coupled with some geographic\\nconsiderations. It has been suggested that a weak EASM (i.e., consistent positive δ18O values in the\\nmonsoonal China) leads to a southward shift of the rain belt that in turn results in either a dipole (i.e.,\\ndry northern China and a wet southern China [44,122,151]) or a tripole pattern (i.e., dry northern and\\nsouthern China but wet in Central China [14]). Therefore, the speleothem δ18O records ultimately show\\nthe integrated monsoonal signal from the moisture source to the cave sites on orbital to millennial\\ntimescales [1], in line with modeling results (e.g., [191,194,197,198]). In this sense, the longstanding\\ndisparity between interpretations of Chinese cave δ18O records may be resolvable through a thorough\\ninvestigation of site-speciﬁc controls on speleothem δ18O and/or independently corroborating records\\nof rainfall intensity.\\n</td>\n",

There are also several other similarities between the δ18O records from\\nSchneckenloch Cave and from Korallgrottan; for instance, there is a good agreement between warmer\\nconditions interpreted from the less negative δ18O values observed in Schneckenloch Cave from ~127.1 to\\n~126.8 ka and more negative δ18O values in Korallgrottan from ~127.23 to ~126.77 ka. These intervals\\nare then followed by colder conditions in both caves indicated by more negative δ18O values between\\n~126.8 and ~125.6 ka in Schneckenloch Cave and less negative δ18O values between ~126.77 and ~125.68 ka\\nin Korallgrottan (Figure 5). To the east, growth of stalagmite BAR-II from Baradla Cave in northeast\\nHungary suggests that temperature and humidity conditions were suitable for speleothem formation\\nfrom ~129 ka [31]. Carbon isotope compositions in stalagmite BAR-II show that interglacial conditions\\ngradually developed from ~128 ka (Figure 5B), and that the period from ~127 to ~123 ka was one of higher\\nhumidity before full interglacial conditions were reached at ~124 ka [31]. The onset of the period of higher\\nhumidity in Baradla fits well with the start of more rapid growth and warmer conditions recorded in\\nnorthwest Sweden. In Baradla Cave, a period of more negative δ13C values in the interval of 126.8 to\\n125.7 ka coincides with the less negative δ18O values in Korallgrottan between ~126.77 and ~125.68 ka.\\nTo the west, the formation of stalagmite BD-inf between ~128 and ~121 ka in Bourgeois-Delaunay Cave\\n(western France) coincides with the warmest part of the LIG, and the most negative δ18O values occur\\nat ~127.7 ka (Figure 5E, [33]). The high-resolution δ18O record from this cave suggests millennial-scale\\nclimate variability during the period from ~128 to ~121 ka, with several periods of drier conditions\\nindicated by less negative δ18O values, interrupting the overall wetter and warmer climate. One of the\\ndrier periods occurs between ~126.3 and ~125.3 ka, closely coinciding with the interval of colder climate\\nconditions recorded in Korallgrottan between ~126.77 and ~125.68 ka (Figure 5A,E).\\n</td>\n",

In addition, the formation and disintegration\\nof the Tianshuihai-Akseqin Lakes on the western QTP during the last 70 ka have great impacts on\\nplateau permafrost and periglacial environments, but were seldom studied. Substantial changes in sea\\nlevel may also have greatly aﬀected Quaternary permafrost in China, because during the cold periods\\nof lower sea levels, many continental shelves of eastern and southern China seas were extensively\\nexposed to the chilly climate and the arctic fronts at much southerly positions, or even closed into\\ninland basins (e.g., [170]). Could some exposed continental shelves have been frozen for a long-term,\\nas some cold climate paleo-fauna and -ﬂora fossils have been unearthed by drilling or excavations in\\nEastern China seas? Many thermokarst lakes and pingos (or pingo scars), as well as (buried) palsas,\\nlithalsas, and peat blankets or plateaus, have been reported on the QTP, in alpine regions in West China\\nand in the northern part of Northeast China. However, their formation and evolutionary processes and\\ntheir relationships with past permafrost remain poorly investigated and largely unknown. How about\\nthe buried and multi-layered permafrost being formed now and during the diﬀerent warm periods\\nof the Quaternary, especially during the numerous interglacials? How to classify and map their\\ndistribution under a warming and cooling climate? How would they impact the alpine ecosystems\\nand hydrology–hydrogeology, as well as engineering geology, and the ecosystems and socio-economic\\nsituation downstream? Additionally, there are large knowledge gaps regarding spatial and temporal\\nrelationships of permafrost and periglacial development and distribution during the Quaternary\\nand each stage at the borders of China and neighboring countries or regions.

       "      <td>The sharp contact between the calcareous gyttja and the overlaying dark brown silty/sandy\\ngyttja could indicate erosion. However, the diﬀerence in macroscopic content of the two layers,\\ntogether with the 14C-dates, suggests only a limited hiatus and minor reworking of the calcareous\\ngyttja (Table 2, Figure 7). Three macrofossil samples were collected from this dark brown gyttja,\\nand it is possibly contemporary with the earliest traces of occupation in the area. The sand content\\nis higher in the dark brown gyttja than in the calcareous gyttja, with the highest concentrations\\nin the lowermost and uppermost part (86.25 and 86.75 m a.s.l.), indicating higher energy in the\\nwater (Figure 5). Plant macrofossils in the lower part of this layer are dated to 8200–7700 cal BC\\n(Figure 7), and it is likely that the material was accumulated in Ancient Lake Vättern (ALV), after its\\ntransgression over Lake Strandvägen, probably shortly after ca. 8000 cal BC. This interpretation of\\nALV incursion is chronologically supported by the complete absence of Tilia pollen, as the ALV brings\\nhigh concentrations of e.g., Betula-, Corylus- and Juniperus pollen into the small basin, and drown local\\nshoreline shrubs such as Hippophäe and Salix (Figure 6). The plant macrofossils in the dark brown gyttja\\nare dominated by species which commonly occur in the Mesolithic contexts at the site [9,34], and lack\\ntraces of the younger ﬂora with meadow and weed vegetation, which characterize the medieval- and\\nIron age material at adjacent sites. The occurrence of elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) and raspberry\\n(Rubus idaeus L.) in the lower part of the gyttja may reﬂect Mesolithic gathering or the local ﬂora.\\nThis interpretation is strengthened by the pollen ﬂora, which contains early Holocene elderberry [35].\\nIn e.g., the Czech Republic, elderberry has been found in Mesolithic archaeological contexts [60], but in\\nScandinavia, the earliest ﬁnds of seeds so far seem to be from the Middle Neolithic in Denmark [61].\\nSmall amounts of charcoal occur in the middle and lower parts of the dark brown gyttja, possibly\\nderiving from a contemporary occupation. The lowermost part of the unit is a coarse-detrital gyttja\\nwhich is ﬁning upwards from ca. 86.4 m a.s.l. This combination of changes in sand content, macrofossils\\nand pollen are interpreted as a successive rise in the water level, leading to greater distance to the\\nshore (Figures 5–7). Alternatively, the sediment could also be explained by reworking caused by a\\nyounger ﬂuvial event, but the lack of plant macrofossils and pollen typical for the younger periods\\n(e.g., Picea and Tilia pollen) make this unlikely. At 86.5 m a.s.l., the sediment is a ﬁne-detrital gyttja\\nwith low sand content and high amounts of Chara sp. macrospores (oospores), indicating deeper\\nwater conditions (Figure 5). We interpret this sediment as deposited during the highest stand of\\nALV, reported to be 92.5 m a.s.l. by [27]. This would indicate that the local water depth at this time\\nwas at most six meters, which is very plausible, considering the micro- and macroscopic content.\\nAt 86.69 m a.s.l., a two cm sandy layer contains the lowermost distinct charcoal horizon (&gt;20 frag.),\\nand the charcoal is, because of the high concentration, most likely of anthropogenic origin. This level\\ncan be interpolated to be 7500–7000 cal BC (Figure 7), and probably reﬂect the ﬁrst fall in water level in\\nthe Vättern basin, as River Motala Ström is formed, causing a sudden regression. It is unclear if the\\ngyttja only contains material deposited in ALV, or if some of the organic material may be reworked\\nfrom the substratum of calcareous gyttja. It is noteworthy that a part of the organic material seems to\\noriginate from occupational waste, not only elderberries and a high amount of charcoal, but also ﬁsh\\nscales and fruits of ﬂoating sweet grass (Glyceria ﬂutans L.) In Scandinavia, this tasty water grass is\\nrecorded as collected food during the Middle Neolithic and later, e.g., in Alvastra Pile dwelling [62].\\nIn the uppermost part (ca. 86.7–86.8 m a.s.l.), the unit is again a sandy coarse-detrital gyttja, which\\nmay reﬂect a lowering of the water level, causing the shore to move closer with its vegetation of reeds\\n(Phragmites australis L.) and rush (Schoenoplectus lacustris Palla). The lowering of the water table is\\nconnected to the channel erosion and successive down-cutting of River Motala Ström, during the ﬁrst\\nregression event in Lake Vättern. The ﬁrst Tilia-pollen appears in the uppermost part of the dark brown\\ngyttja (coarse-detrital gyttja at 86.77 m a.s.l.), which dates it to ca. 6200 cal BC or later [19], although\\nthe pollen grains appear to be corroded, which might indicate some redeposition.\\n</td>\n",

There are a few studies about the spatial-scale\\nvariations in mulches on runoff and soil loss. Poesen et\\nal. (1994) reviewed the effects of rock fragments on soil ero-\\nsion and stated that the spatial scale has an important impact\\non the soil erosion. They showed that, on the microplot scale\\n(4 mm2 to 1 m2), sediment yield reached a maximum value\\nwith 0 % rock fragment cover and reached a minimum value\\nwith 100 % rock fragment cover. On the mesoplot scale (i.e.,\\ninterrill areas), negative, positive as well as convex upward\\nrelationships with cover percentages have been observed, de-\\npending on the ﬁne-earth structure, on the vertical position\\nin the topsoil, on the size of rock fragments and on the sur-\\nface slope. Finally, on the macroplot scale (i.e., interrill and\\nrill areas; 10–10 000 m2), sediment yield decreased exponen-\\ntially with rock fragment cover. Cerdan et al. (2002) investi-\\ngated the scale effect (plot to catchment) on runoff in agricul-\\ntural areas of Normandy, France. Three databases – 450 m2\\nplots, a 90 ha catchment and an 1100 ha catchment – were\\nselected to collect runoff data. Between the three scales, a\\nsigniﬁcant decrease in the runoff coefﬁcient was observed as\\nthe area increased. Mingguo et al. (2007) also studied the ef-\\nfect of vegetation on the runoff–sediment-yield relationship\\non different spatial scales (plot to watershed) in hilly areas\\nof the Loess Plateau, northern China, and found that vegeta-\\ntion could reduce runoff and soil loss on both scales but that,\\non a plot scale, the reduction rate of sediment was more than\\nthe runoff. Smets et al. (2008a) reviewed the impact of plot\\nlength on the effectiveness of different soil surface covers\\nin reducing runoff and soil loss. The results indicated that,\\nfor plot lengths &lt; 11 m, there was a large variation in the\\nrunoff and erosion-reducing effectiveness of each soil cover,\\ndepending on various factors. Smets et al. (2008b) also exam-\\nined the spatial-scale effects on the effectiveness of organic\\nmulches in reducing soil erosion in ﬁeld and laboratory ex-\\nperiments (plot length ranges between 0.1 and 30.5 m). Re-\\nsults veriﬁed the effectiveness of mulches in reducing soil\\nerosion by water on various scales. In addition, they showed\\na positive linear relation between the erosion-reducing ef-\\nfectiveness of an organic mulch cover and plot length. In\\nshort plots, the response of a soil surface cover to runoff and\\nsoil loss was immediately observed. Nevertheless, on longer\\nplots, the runoff and soil loss response could be compensated\\nfor due to the longer plot length. Fernández et al. (2012)\\nstudied the seeding and the mulching and seeding effects on\\npost-ﬁre runoff and soil erosion in Galicia (NW Spain), with\\na rainfall rate of 67 mm h−1 at plot scale.

The second, more pervasive phase of cemen-\\ntation is documented by the intragranular cement observed\\nin all the nodules. The mosaic of blocky sparite with coarse\\ncrystals and homogeneous distribution also point to phreatic\\nconditions (Longman, 1980; Flügel, 2013; Adams and Dia-\\nmond, 2017). The intergranular cement pattern is analogous\\nin DB-parallel nodules and bedding-parallel nodules, mean-\\ning they probably formed in a similar phreatic environment.\\nOxygen isotope data suggest a meteoric environment\\n(Fig. 12a). According to the compilation made by Nelson and\\nSmith (1996), the moderately depleted δ18O and δ13C values\\nwe found in both types of nodules (Fig. 12a) are grouped\\nin the ﬁeld of “meteoric cements” (Nelson and Smith, 1996)\\nand are in support of precipitation under meteoric conditions.\\nThe δ18O values of DB-parallel nodule cement correspond to\\nparent ﬂuids with an oxygen isotope composition (δ18Oﬂuid)\\nvarying from −5.42 ‰ to −2.31 ‰ Vienna Standard Mean\\nOcean Water (VSMOW) (precipitation at 14 ◦C) or from\\n−4.01 ‰ to −0.90 ‰ VSMOW (precipitation at 20 ◦C; see\\nSupplement S4 for details on the back calculation of δ18O\\nof parent ﬂuids). These values are slightly less depleted if\\ncompared with the expected δ18O of present-day meteoric\\nﬂuids characterizing this area (−8/− 6 ‰; Giustini et al.,\\n2016). The isotopic signal of the cementing ﬂuids may have\\nbeen buffered by interaction with the host rock (dissolution\\nof detrital marine shells in the sandstone framework; e.g.,\\nFig. 10c–d), by mixing with local formation water (McBride\\net al., 1995), or, for instance, by more regional factors (e.g.,\\natmospheric temperature, humidity, precipitation, seasonal-\\nity of precipitation and recharge, vegetation; Cortecci et al.,\\n2008; Jasechko, 2019). In this view, further investigations\\nwould be needed to properly constrain the cementing ﬂuid\\nconditions (e.g., clumped isotopes, ﬂuid inclusions). The\\nδ13C composition of cement (Fig. 12a), however, seems to\\nreﬂect soil weathering processes as the primary source of\\nbicarbonate dissolved in the waters (Hudson, 1977; Nelson\\nand Smith, 1996) and supports precipitation from meteoric\\nﬂuids. DB-parallel and bedding-parallel nodules show a sim-\\nilar composition for δ18O; however, bedding-parallel nodules\\nhave more depleted δ13C values. This might reﬂect a higher\\ncontribution of organic carbon from soil-derived CO2 (Hud-\\nson, 1977), possibly indicating that bedding-parallel nodules\\nformed in shallower conditions with respect to DB-parallel\\nnodules. Another explanation is that the two types of nodules\\nwere formed by different episodes of water inﬂow with dif-\\nferent (external) environmental conditions. The difference in\\nisotopic composition between these two types of nodules in-\\ndeed suggests different cement precipitation timing and wa-\\nter compositions as proposed by McBride et al. (1995) and\\nMilliken et al. (1998). Phreatic meteoric conditions for nod-\\nule formation point to a shallow diagenesis, and it is consis-\\ntent with the shallow burial depths estimated for the Loiano\\nSandstones (see Sect. 7.1).\\n</td>\n",

In the geothermal domain, such projects constitute\\nexpensive experiments and thus are relatively few in num-\\nber, whereas, in the oil and gas domain, where hydro-fracture\\noperations are frequent and routine, the data tend to be pro-\\nprietary.

Well-\\ndocumented hydraulic stimulation datasets generally include\\nmicroseismic observations as well as injection pressures and\\nﬂow rates and, occasionally, tilt monitoring (Evans, 1983;\\nWarpinski and Teufel, 1997). Although much information\\ncan be gained from these datasets, including imaging of\\nmicroseismic structures (Niitsuma et al., 1999; Maxwell,\\n2014), energy balance between injected ﬂuids and seismic\\nenergy release (Boroumand and Eaton 2012; Zoback et al.,\\n2012; Warpinski, 2013), and source mechanisms (Jupe et al.,\\n1992; Deichmann and Ernst, 2009; Warpinski and Du, 2010;\\nHorálek et al., 2010), the constraints placed on the processes\\nare insufﬁcient to resolve details of the hydromechanical pro-\\ncesses that underpin permeability enhancement, ﬂow-path\\nlinkage, channeling or the interaction with natural fractures.\\nMany of these processes possibly also depend on rock type.\\nFor instance, case studies analyzed by Evans et al. (2012)\\nsupport the notion that injection into sedimentary rock tends\\nto be less seismogenic than in crystalline rock. Moreover, it\\nis likely that a signiﬁcant part of the permeability creation\\nprocesses take place in an aseismic manner (Cornet et al.,\\n1997; Evans, 1998; Guglielmi et al., 2015b; Zoback et al.,\\n2012), implying that seismic monitoring may only illuminate\\nparts of the stimulated rock volume. In many deep hydraulic\\nstimulation projects the rock mass is only accessed by one\\nor at most a few boreholes, and the structural and geologi-\\ncal models of the reservoir are not well deﬁned.

Mo-\\nbilization and microbial oxidation of these hydrocarbons to\\nform dissolved carbonate (Baedecker et al., 1993; Tuccillo et\\nal., 1999) has been shown in other fault settings to form cal-\\ncite veins with low δ13C values (e.g., Eichhubl et al., 2009).\\nIn addition to ﬂuid mixing over a range of temperatures,\\nother processes that occur during vein formation can also re-\\nsult in a range of calcite O and C stable isotope values.

This is shown in Figure 3b, where a smaller HM results in a more \\nnegative HM Cu isotope composition. We calculate a range of HM Cu isotope \\ncompositions because our preliminary experiments were simply used to assess the \\nsense, not the magnitude of isotope fractionation; however, because large isotope \\nfractionations (> 2 ‰) are not expected at the temperatures associated with the \\nformation of a HM (3000-4000 K), a minimum thickness of ~2 km is predicted, \\neven for the most Cu-rich HM. The maximum size for each HM as controlled \\nby its Cu concentration corresponds to a minimum Δ65Cusulphide-silicate value of \\n~ –0.6 ‰. To further constrain this model, further work is required to accurately \\nparameterise  Cu  isotope  fractionation  factors,  but  these  model  predictions  are \\nin general agreement with our experimental data (Supplementary Information).\\nAdmixing a Fe-O-S liquid into Earth’s core will affect core composition, \\nspecifically  with  regard  to  the  light  elements  S  and  O.  Given  the  constraints \\nprovided above (HM mass ≤ 1.6 % of Earth’s core), addition of a HM to the core \\nwill have a small effect on the core O composition (< 0.25 wt. % addition); for S, \\nthe effect is more significant – our model suggests that up to ~0.5 wt. % S could be \\nadded (Fig. 3a), which is in line with recent estimates based on molecular dynamics \\n(Badro  et  al.,  2014)  and  siderophile  element  partitioning  studies  (Siebert  et  al., \\n2013) – of course, this does not preclude further core addition of S as a metal alloy.\\nFinally, we estimate the effect that removal of the HM could have on mantle \\nlead isotope composition. Lead can be strongly chalcophile, and an early fraction-\\nation of isotopically primitive Pb by a sulphide-rich phase is often cited as a solu-\\ntion to the 1st terrestrial Pb paradox; that is, the observation that, in 206Pb/204Pb \\nvs. 207Pb/204Pb space, most mantle-derived rocks, continental sediments etc. plot \\nto the right of the terrestrial geochron (either the meteoritic, 4.568 Ga geochron \\nor the later Hf-W core formation cessation age of ~4.53 Ga, Fig. 4; Kramers and \\nTolstikhin,  1997).  Modelling  the  evolution  of  mantle  Pb  isotope  composition \\nresulting  from  two  fractionation  events,  metal-silicate  equilibration  at  50  Ma \\nand  sulphide-silicate  equilibration  at  100  Ma  (following  Galer  and  Goldstein, \\n1996; see Supplementary Information for details), predicts a present-day mantle \\nPb isotopic composition that is comparable to empirical estimates for BSE, albeit \\nthe more unradiogenic ones (Fig. 4; Halliday, 2004) as well as the Pb composi-\\ntion  of  the  ancient  primitive  mantle  as  estimated  using  flood  basalts  (Jackson \\nand  Carlson,  2011).  Therefore,  this  does  not  preclude  further  unradiogenic  Pb \\nreservoirs, such as sulphides in refractory mantle phases (Burton et al., 2012) or \\nlate accretion of mantle Pb (Albarède, 2009).\\n\n",

However,  within  the  3–30  m  interval  that  contains  the \\ncalcareous and grey shale we observed flaser, pin-stripe and lenticular bedding; \\nmultiple  reactivation  surfaces;  mud  drapes  and  herringbone  cross-lamination \\n(Fig. 1). These features are strong evidence of tidally influenced sedimentation on \\nmarine tidal flats (Davis Jr., 2012). Closely interfingered marine and non-marine \\ndeposition is not uncommon in the rock record. For example, recent discoveries \\nof tidal indicators in the Ordovician Juniata Formation raised doubts about some \\nof the oldest purported evidence for land colonisation by animal life (Davies et al., \\n2010). Our sedimentological observations raise similar concerns for the eukary-\\notic biota of the Stoer Group (Cloud and Germs, 1971). This view is supported \\nby our geochemical data, which are most parsimoniously explained by a marine \\ninfluence during the deposition of the middle Poll a’Mhuilt Member (~3–30 m).\\nCarbonate-bound  87Sr/86Sr  ratios  capture  the  isotope  composition  of  the \\nwater column in which the carbonate precipitated. As typical continental runoff \\nis more radiogenic (87Sr-enriched) than seawater, 87Sr/86Sr values can distinguish \\nbetween marine and non-marine environments (Veizer et al., 1990; Spencer and \\nPatchett,  1997).  However,  infiltration  of  secondary  fluids  during  early  or  late \\ndiagenesis  typically  increases  carbonate  87Sr/86Sr  ratios  (Banner  and  Hanson, \\n1990). Covariation and low values of δ18Ocarb and δ13Ccarb, as seen in our samples, \\nmay indicate some degree of alteration by continental fluids (Fig. 3c) (Shields and \\nVeizer, 2002; Bartley and Kah, 2004). However, alteration almost always leads to \\nmore  radiogenic  carbonate  87Sr/86Sr  ratios  (Banner  and  Hanson,  1990).  Diage-\\nnetic fluids were likely sourced from the surrounding land surface and should \\nhave reflected the composition of the Lewisian tonalite-trondjemite-granodiorite \\ngneiss (0.740 ± 0.033; Lyon et al., 1975; this study; and see Supplementary Informa-\\ntion for discussion). Therefore, the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of our least radiogenic carbonate \\nend-member  (0.707,  Fig.  3b),  directly  from  within  the  sulphide-  and  Mo-rich \\ninterval  (Parnell  et  al.,  2015),  provides  a  maximum  constraint  for  the  primary \\n87Sr/86Sr ratio of the water body from which the carbonate precipitated. This value \\nis too low to reflect exclusively continental runoff from the Lewisian basement \\n(>0.715), which should dominate the signal in a lacustrine setting. Instead, this \\nvalue is better explained by mixing between fluvial and marine waters. The latter \\nhave an estimated composition of 0.705–0.706 at 1.2 Ga (Kuznetsov et al., 2014).\\nRepetitive  influxes  of  seawater,  followed  by  evaporation,  would  favour \\nthe  precipitation  of  gypsum  as  recorded  by  pseudomorphs  in  the  middle  Poll \\na’Mhuilt Member (3–30 m, Fig. 1). As previously proposed (Parnell et al., 2010, \\n2015), a combination of proxies—including large S isotope fractionations consis-\\ntent  with  pyrite  formation  in  the  water  column,  high  Mo/Re  ratios  and  large \\namounts of pyrite despite low TOC contents (low C/S ratios)—suggest that the \\nwater column turned euxinic (sulphidic) during the evaporitic phase, perhaps as \\na result of salinity stratification and cut-off from seawater inflow. This pattern \\nis supported by the Fe chemistry (see Supplementary Information for detailed \\ndiscussion).

The benchmark structure was built with a 4 × 2 column scheme (4 columns in the\\ntransversal direction (8 m spaced) and 2 in the longitudinal direction (10 m spaced)) and modelled to\\nhave periods in the range of those of residential buildings, considering 3 ﬂoors (a 3.4 m storey height,\\nwith a total structure height of 10.2 m). The structure was modelled as a superposition of two schemes\\n(Figure 6). Both vertical and horizontal elements were composed by RC concrete columns and beams,\\nrespectively, and characterized by ﬁber section models. Concrete02 material [56,57] was chosen to\\nmodel the core and the cover portions (Figure 7a,b, respectively) of the section (0.40 m × 0.40 m) and\\nwith the parameters deﬁned in Table 2. The ratio between the unloading slope (related to the maximum\\nstrength) and the initial slope was taken as equal to 0.1. A total of 30 bars were used and represented\\nby Steel02 material [58], with the properties shown in Table 3 and the ratio between the post-yield\\ntangent and initial elastic tangent equal to 0.01 (Figure 8). The parameters that control the transition\\nfrom elastic to plastic branches were assumed R0 = 15, CR1 = 0.925 and CR2 = 0.15, as suggested\\nby [53]. The masonry walls were modelled as equivalent diagonal elasticBeamColumn elements [52,53],\\nin both the longitudinal and transversal directions. The masonry walls’ properties were selected based\\non the Italian code provisions, with low-to-medium mechanical characteristics (Table C8A.2.1 [59]),\\nas shown in Table 4. Table 5 shows the vibration periods of the structure with and without the inﬁll\\nmasonry walls. It is worth noting that the masonry walls aﬀect the structural natural period (from\\n0.3012 s to 0.2085 s), since they increase the lateral stiﬀness of the whole structure (as shown in [60]).\\nIn particular, the inﬁll masonry walls introduce diﬀerent mechanisms that may signiﬁcantly modify the\\nseismic behavior of the structure. The foundation was modelled as a 0.50-m-deep rectangular concrete\\nraft foundation (28.4 m × 34.4 m) in order to represent the recurring shallow foundation typologies for\\nresidential buildings. These types of foundation can be particularly vulnerable due to their bearing\\ncapacity, which depends only on the contact pressure and not on the frictional mechanisms (as in\\nthe case of deep foundations). The considered foundation was assumed to be rigid, by tying all the\\ncolumns base nodes together with those of the soil domain surface, using equalDOF [52,53]. Horizontal\\nrigid beam-column links were set normal to the column longitudinal axis to simulate the interface\\nbetween the column and the foundation. The foundation was designed by calculating the eccentricity\\n(the ratio between the overturning bending moment at the foundation level and the vertical forces)\\nin the most detrimental condition of the minimum vertical loads (gravity and seismic loads) and\\nmaximum bending moments. The foundation was modelled with an equivalent concrete material, by\\napplying the Pressure Independent Multi-Yield model [52,53] (Table 6). This model consists of a non-linear\\nhysteretic material with a Von Mises multi-surface kinematic plasticity model, which can simulate\\na monotonic or cyclic response of materials whose shear behavior is insensitive to the conﬁnement\\nchange. The nonlinear shear stress-strain backbone curve is represented by the hyperbolic relation,\\ndeﬁned by the two material constants (low-strain shear modulus and ultimate shear strength) [52,53].\\n\n",

Furthermore, the reviewed topic has persisted for about a decade. However, two serious\\nbiases are found. First, the number of published works remains restricted (Figure 1), which means\\nthat each principal topic is covered by a limited number of publications (Table 2). One would expect\\nmore frequent analysis of geoheritage and climbing due to their natural concurrence. Second, there is\\na large geographical bias because of the limited global dispersal of the reviewed research (Figure 2).\\nThe information is absent from many mountainous domains of the world, including the Andes,\\nthe Himalaya, and many other mountain chains of the Americas, Africa, Australia, and even Europe.\\nIt is impossible to believe that their rich geoheritage occurs where climbers are absent, and vice versa.\\nThe critical consideration of the research on geoheritage and climbing activities allows the\\nidentiﬁcation of some important research gaps to be ﬁlled by further investigation. First, the majority of\\nthe reviewed sources reﬂect a “positivist” view, which generally considers geoconservation/geotourism\\nand climbing as mutually important activities. Environmental concerns and safety concerns also exist,\\nbut these research lines are less important. Apparently, too little is still known about geoheritage\\ndamage and loss at climbing sites, as well as about the challenges for climbers linked to geoheritage\\nestablishment. Second, there is only weak evidence of the climbers’ interest in geoheritage, geoeducation,\\nand geoconservation. Similarly, it is unclear how many geotourists are ready for a climbing experience,\\neven if minimal and the simplest. In other words, any successful relationship between geoheritage\\nand climbing activities requires curiosity and education demand from climbers, and physical training\\nand certain risk-taking by geotourists. Third, the available research does not provide evidence of\\nhow “ordinary” geotourists and professional climbers may tolerate each other. One may hypothesize\\nthat the concentration of climbers will make a given geosite less attractive to geotourists due to\\napparent diﬃculty of routes, and crowding by geotourists will distract climbers (it would be diﬃcult\\nto feel like an outstanding peak conqueror while surrounded by dozens of “just tourists”). Fourth,\\nmore attention should be paid to geoparks. These establishments serve geotourists (sensu stricto)\\nand many other types of tourists, and these may be essential for joint development of geoheritage\\nmanagement, geotourism, and climbing activities. Although some reviewed sources focus on geoparks\\n(Table 1), the wide international networks of the latter [7,23,24,29] oﬀer more opportunities for analysis\\nof the above-mentioned joint development. Fifth, the geographical focus of the reviewed research\\ndirection is centered on continents or big islands (Table 1, Figure 2). However, the example of the\\nAzores [118] indicates that small islands can be important geoheritage localities oﬀering various\\nopportunities for climbing activities. It should be also noted that many oceanic islands are often\\nstressed by tsunamis, extreme storms, and super-typhoons, with megaclasts a signature feature (e.g., see\\nreview in [80]). Megaclasts are essentially geoheritage objects (due to the uniqueness of their size\\n\n",

It is an excellent example of shallow-water Triassic–Upper Cretaceous carbonates covered by a\\nmargin to deep basin succession from Maastrichtian to Serravallian in age. The authors relate this\\ndeepening of the depositional environment with the Late Cretaceous–Paleogene abortive rifting that\\noccurred in Adria, in analogy with that observed from Libya to southern Sicily [49]. A similar margin to\\nslope succession characterizes the Mt Croce unit. It starts with Upper Cretaceous–Paleocene calcareous\\nbreccias, corresponding to the Calcari Cristallini Fm, a widespread recrystallized calcareous clastic\\ndeposit, marking the start of the platform sinking in several places of the southern Apennines [7,8,49].\\nThe succession passes upward to a thick, scaglia-type slope calciclastics deposit and basin calcilutites,\\nmarls, and argillites. The succession ends with Serravallian foredeep sandstones corresponding to the\\nsimilar sediments in the Laviano area. Finally, unconformable deposits of the upper Tortonian–lower\\nMessinian CVTG cover both successions. This close analogy suggests a similar paleogeographic\\nposition in the uppermost Cretaceous, where they formed the eastern margin of the Apennine Platform.\\nFurthermore, both margin successions were involved in the same out-of-sequence thrusting event [11].\\nThe structural analysis presented in the previous paragraphs gives us some inputs to propose a\\npossible reconstruction of the tectonic events of this key sector of the southern Apennines. The best place\\nto observe the superposition between the diﬀerent orogenic stages is the Salitto outcrop (Campagna\\ntectonic window). Here, we have recognized the superposition of ﬁve deformation stages in the footwall\\nof the out-of-sequence thrust, which juxtaposes the Frigento unit onto the Mt Croce unit, with the\\ninterposition of the CVTG rocks. The ﬁrst (D1) includes regional thrusts and minor mesoscale thrusts\\nwith related folds, all deﬁned by a vergence to the E/SE. This in-sequence thrusting event allowed\\nthe tectonic covering of the Apennine Platform rocks (Picentini Mts unit) onto the Lagonegro-Molise\\nBasin deposits (Frigento unit). The second stage (D2) was recorded by normal faults, deformed by\\nthe subsequent shortening deformations. As suggested by [11,31], we associate this extensional event\\nwith the formation of several structural depressions where the CVTG sediments were deposited.\\nA synorogenic extensional environment was also envisaged for the older Langhian–lower Tortonian\\nwedge-top basin deposits of the Cilento Group [27,28,31]. A recent study [50] in the Cilento area\\n(Figure 1a) about temperature-dependent clay minerals and vitrinite reﬂectance in the Cilento Group\\nand Mt Sacro Fm (CVTG) indicates a basin evolution marked by two phases of severe subsidence,\\ninterpreted as the result of syn-orogenic extension at shallow crustal levels. Hence, this extensional\\nevent occurred in the southern Apennines with the deposition of CVTG sediments within structurally\\ncontrolled depocenters. Furthermore, in several outcrops of the southern Apennines, including those\\nlocalized in the Campagna tectonic window, the base of CVTG deposits is marked by carbonate\\nconglomerates with an arenaceous matrix [14,15,40,51–53]. This feature could mark the erosion of\\ncarbonates placed in the footwall of the D2 normal faults.\\n\n",

Further, the ACTIVE product exhibits a high average\\nstudy domain wide inter-pixel soil moisture time series cross-correlation, which in itself is suspicious\\nwhen considering that neighbouring pixels even with very different soil/vegetation type distributions\\ncorrelate to a high degree with each other. Some correlation is of course expected since top soil\\nmoisture, in particular, is heavily inﬂuenced by precipitation, but for this to occur with neighbouring\\ncells with very different soil/vegetation type distributions is suspicious. In fact, the ACTIVE product’s\\ninter-pixel soil moisture cross-correlation dependency on distance resembles that of precipitation.\\nTherefore, it is possible, and even reasonable, to suspect that the ESA CCI ACTIVE soil moisture\\nproduct actually represents moisture changes in vegetation, tree canopies, and so on. Many other\\nprevious studies (e.g., [22,23]) have also come to similar conclusions. The exclusion of the ACTIVE\\nproduct, for most pixels during the latter years of the analysis period, in producing the COMBINED\\nproduct is therefore reasonable. However, there might be other additional reasons for the exclusion of\\nthe ACTIVE product in the COMBINED product, which are not investigated as part of this study. In\\ncontrast, the PASSIVE and SAC-SMA models exhibit a fairly low negative inter-pixel soil moisture\\ncross-correlation dependency on distance. The ESA CCI PASSIVE soil moisture product correlates\\nwell with pixels containing large organic soil fractions. Organic soils (bogs) tend to react slowly to\\nprecipitation and represent soil moisture change as a smooth trend. Since organic soils represent a\\ntrend, correlation to this is as a positive thing. The PASSIVE product also exhibits poor correlation\\nwith pixels containing large fractions of shallow soils, i.e., rapidly responding type soils. This suggests\\nthat the ESA CCI PASIIVE product is able to, in most cases, capture the temporal trend in soil moisture\\nvariation. However, although the trend is seemingly captured, the rapid response to precipitation\\nevents is less accurate. With the ACTIVE product, although there is a very signiﬁcant dependency on\\nshallow soils fraction size to SAC-SMA model correlation, there is no other statistically signiﬁcant\\nsoil/vegetation type predictor that explains ESA CCI ACTIVE SM product performance. This and the\\nhigh degree of inter-pixel, distance-based spatial association are strong indicators that the ACTIVE\\nproduct’s soil moisture ﬂuctuations are largely unresponsive to changes in soil types between the\\npixels. It should, however, be noted that the relatively large measurement footprints, with magnitudes\\nof tens of kilometres, of both the ACTIVE and PASSIVE soil moisture retrieval sensors used to derive\\nthe ESA CCI SM products, may be partly to blame for the high inter-pixel distance-based spatial\\nassociations found in our study. In particular, this is relevant when considering that the ESA CCI SM\\nproduct pixels are in comparison relatively small at only 26 by 10 km. Further studies focusing on\\ninter-pixel distance-based spatial association should be conducted with the original EO-datasets used\\nto derive the ESA CCI SM products and with a much larger study domain.\\n\n",

The exploration\\ncase histories are largely from Australian test sites and describe how spectral sensing technologies\\nhave progressed from early “niche creation” systems, such as the ﬁeld PIMA-II (Portable Field\\nMineral Analyzer) and airborne Geoscan, HyMap™ and OARS-TIPS (Operational Airborne Remote\\nSensing – Thermal Infrared Proﬁling Spectrometer) systems and drill-core HyLogger™ systems,\\nto the current expanding array of pubic and commercial mineral mapping sensors, including the\\nASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂectance Radiometer) satellite system which\\nhas acquired imagery spanning the entire Earth’s land surface (<83◦ latitude). These sensors are\\ndelivering voluminous spectral data from different parts of the visible to the thermal infrared (400 to\\n14,000 nm) spectrum at different spectral, radiometric and spatial resolutions. Two critical exploration\\nchallenges are central to the case histories, namely: (i) can surface cover, such as vegetation, regolith\\nor transported materials, be characterized and accounted for so that the target geology is accurately\\nrevealed; and (ii) does this revealed geology show evidence of alteration footprints to potential\\neconomic mineralization. Spectrally measurable minerals important to solving these challenges\\ninclude white micas, kaolinite and garnets, with measurement of their respective physicochemistries\\nbeing key. For example, kaolin disorder is useful for mapping transported versus weathered in situ\\nmaterials, while the chemical substitution in white micas and garnets provide vectors to potential\\neconomic mineralization. Importantly, appropriate selection of the optimum sensor/data type for\\na given geological application depends primarily on the level of detail/accuracy of the mineral\\ninformation required by the user. A major opportunity is to now harness the many sensor/data\\ntypes and deliver to users consistent, accurate mineral information products, that is, creation of\\na number of valuable global mineral product standards. As part of this vision, CSIRO has been\\ndeveloping improved sensor/data calibration processes and information extraction methods that for\\nexample, unmix the target mineralogy from green and dry vegetation cover in remote sensing data\\nsets. Emphasis to date has been on generating public spectral-mineral product standards, especially at\\nASTER’s limited but geologically-valuable spectral resolution. The results are showing that scalable,\\nglobal, three-dimensional (3D) mineral maps are achievable which will only improve our ability\\nto more accurately characterize regolith and geological architecture, increase our understanding of\\nformative processes and assist the discovery of new economic mineral systems.\\n\n",

After subtraction of these losses from the estimated total mass loss, there is\\nstill a considerable amount of missing material (ranging from 4.0 to 6.8 wt %), and it is plausible to\\nassume that it escaped to the atmosphere mainly during thermal treatment or perhaps as ﬁne material\\nduring sample collection, as well. Of the major elements, none (except LOI) can be considered to\\nbe volatile at perlite treatment temperatures; therefore, it is unlikely to involve volatilisation of a\\nmajor compound other than that of crystalline water. The composition of minerals released from the\\nexpanded perlite is reﬂected in the elemental losses from the expanded material relative to its crude\\nparent sample (Table S1). Isocon analysis revealed that a group of elements show consistent losses\\nabove the measured total mass loss of the CCP, which suggests that they escaped preferentially in\\nthe drops; hence, their behaviour can be explained by their selective partitioning in crystals rather\\nthan the groundmass. The elements of the second group that show losses similar to the total mass loss\\nare considered to be partitioned equally in the groundmass (which mostly remained in the expanded\\nmaterial or secondarily escaped as airborne particles) and the crystals (that escaped mostly as drops).\\nElements that show losses less than the total mass loss indicate their strong connection with the\\ngroundmass; hence, their losses may be related only to the escape of airborne particles from the system.\\nLOI diminishes signiﬁcantly after expansion (Figure 4, Table S1), presumably because of the loss\\nof combined water, which is the main factor that reinforces perlite expansion. Eu and Sr substitute\\nreadily for Ca in the plagioclase structure [19,20]; therefore, their consistent losses reﬂect the prominent\\nremoval of plagioclases in the drops. Losses of Fe2O3 and TiO2 are associated with the removal of\\nilmenite and biotite from the expanded perlite sample. The loss of Ta is also connected with the\\nremoval of ilmenite from the Tsigrado expanded perlite sample, since this high ﬁeld strength element\\nis known to participate in the structure of Fe–Ti phases [21]. MgO loss from the expanded perlite\\nsample is consistent with the removal of biotite in drops during expansion, whereas the depletion of\\nlimited spinel may also contribute to MgO loss. Losses of Zr are related to zircon removal, whereas the\\nlosses of Pb (and Cu, which, however, can participate in other sulphides too) reﬂect the removal of\\ngalena from the expanded perlite. Tl loss may be assigned to the removal of K-feldspars and micas\\nafter expansion, since it is known to participate in these mineral structures [22,23]; however, limited\\nK, Rb and Ba losses do not substantiate that K-feldspar escape was prominent (see below). Tl and\\nPb are very volatile elements [24] and perlite treatment temperatures are in the range of their 50%\\ncondensation temperature, which strongly suggests that signiﬁcant amounts of these elements are\\nvolatilised partially and escape in the atmosphere.\\n\n",

Many typical vibration bands can be found on IR spectra of different clay minerals, while\\nthe spectra of halloysite in the range 550~1350 cm−1 are similar to kaolinite [53], so the ascriptions\\nare often difﬁcult to be recognized, but they still have some distinctive bands. Each vibration line\\nis assigned to the stretching or deformation of the groups and bonds in the samples according\\nto the literature [48,54–57]; the FTIR spectra of Hal from different regions are shown in Figure 2\\nand the ascriptions are included in Table 2, respectively. The double adsorption bands at around\\n3696 cm−1 and 3620 cm−1 were ascribed to the stretching vibration of the adsorbed water. The peaks\\nat 3696 cm−1 corresponded to the stretching of perpendicular surface –OH groups, and the band at\\naround 3620 cm−1 is ascribed to the stretching of –OH coordinated with the tetrahedral sheet and\\noctahedral sheet located in the unit cell of Hal structural. The peak at 1642~1650 cm−1 could be\\nascribed to the bending of –OH in adsorbed water (for better recognition of the typical IR bands in\\nthe range 400~1200 cm−1, the spectra in the range 1200~3000 cm−1 were not shown for clarity of the\\nfringes in mid-infrared part). The intensity of the H–O–H deformation band at 1642 cm−1 increased\\nwith decreasing degree of structural order, and the band increased with the increasing of inter-layer\\nwater contents. The broad bands in the range adsorption band at 950~1150 cm−1 originated from\\nthe Si–O stretching vibrations in all kinds of silicate-based clay minerals. The main absorption was\\ndetected at 1030 cm−1, with a trace of shoulder at around 1010 cm−1, which were often ascribed to\\nthe asymmetric in-plane Si–O–Si stretching. The same in-plane stretching of apical Si–O bonds were\\ndetected at 1094 cm−1. Furthermore, the symmetric stretching of Si–O bonds involving the basal\\noxygen atoms can be observed at 1116 cm−1. All of the Si–O stretching bands are similar for the Hal\\nsamples, with the exception of Hal-SY sample, which illustrated a relatively stronger band at 1116\\ncm−1, conﬁrming that the Hal-SY sample should have more fragments or imperfections in the lattice.\\nThis has been and will be further veriﬁed in the following characterizations. The adsorption peak at\\naround 910 cm−1 could be ascribed to the –OH deformation of inner hydroxyls [58], which illustrated\\na small shift to the higher wavenumber position (913 cm−1) for Hal-SY sample, indicating the different\\nhydration state of this sample. The spectral bands from 690~800 cm−1 could be designated to the\\nstretching of the Si–O lattice. The symmetric stretching was detected at 793 cm−1, and the doublet\\nbands observed at 756 cm−1 and 695 cm−1 originated from the perpendicular stretching of Si–O bonds\\nprobably involving to surface hydroxyls. The double adsorption peaks at 534 cm−1 and 468 cm−1 were\\nascribed to the bending vibration of the Si–O groups. The former should result from the deformation\\nof Al–O–Si frames, and the latter should have originated from the deformation of Si–O–Si bonds. The\\nsmall bands at 432 cm−1 and 418 cm−1 should also come from the stretching of Si–O bonds in [SiO4]\\ntetrahedral frameworks. The FTIR spectra of the different Hal showed nearly similar shapes with very\\nlittle deviations, only the Hal-SY has some tiny differences in the positions or relative intensities of\\nthe vibration bands, which conﬁrms that the acquired Hal minerals has the same basic structures, but\\nremains to have some differences in the individual samples.\\n\n",

In block caving,\\nhigh ore columns are being caved, and the drawing of caved material takes place at the bottom of\\nthe block. During this process, caved rock fragments are subjected to the gravity ﬂow, and their size\\nis changed as a function of the length of the distance traveled. Proper design of the drawing points\\ninside the block caving mines requires proper determination of the secondary rock fragmentation\\nin order to avoid the draw point jamming and loss. The key point here is to notice that during the\\ncaving and gravity ﬂow of the broken rock, the size of the rock fragments is changed, as well as the\\nfrictional properties of their surfaces. Secondary fragmentation in block caving is identiﬁed as one\\nof the most inﬂuential parameters on gravity ﬂow formation [41–43]. While in block caving mines,\\ncaved rock mass is subjected to the gravity ﬂow inside the geometry of one column, and this takes\\nplace until the production is ﬁnished, the sublevel caving mines situation is slightly different. Ore is\\nblasted and loaded from the sublevel drifts in slices that advance along the sublevel drift. During the\\nore loading, the gravity ﬂow of broken ore and caved waste material is formed, and after the ﬁnishing\\nof the production at one sublevel, production continues at the next, lower one. In this manner, caved\\nrock mass is traveling just in smaller portions, but in the end, it is subjected to the same process as\\nthe caved mass in block caving mines. This means that upper sublevels will face the caved waste\\nrock that has coarser fragmentation, while lower sublevels will have different states of the caved rock\\nmass, which has ﬁner fragmentation and different frictional properties. During the gravity ﬂow, those\\nrock blocks are rubbed against each other, and their surfaces become smoother; their friction angle\\nis closer to the basic friction angle [44] for that rock type. This means that those rock fragments will\\nhave smaller kinematic resistance and may easily come to the loading point and mix with the ore,\\nproducing its dilution. These changes are illustrated in Figure 2. However, friction and the size of the\\nrock fragments are changed simultaneously, and those changes should be analyzed together. The real\\nsituation in sublevel mines depends on the actual geological conditions that are present in a certain\\nmine. Primary block sizes and their frictional properties are determined by the jointing of the rock\\nmass. This should be the starting point for the research of sublevel gravity ﬂow. It is well known that\\nrock mass that is caved is subjected to the tensile failure, and the surfaces of the rock blocks that are\\ncreated in this manner are very rough [45–47]. However, other surfaces of the caved rock fragments\\nare determined by the quality of the joint walls that created those surfaces. This means that on some\\noccasions, those surfaces may have a lower friction angle than the basic friction angle. Due to the\\n\n",

In deep-marine\\nenvironments, volcanic ashes are precursor materials of bentonites, and thus bentonites have\\na diagenetic origin rather than a sedimentary origin.\\nIn this environment, the K, Ca and Mg\\nare readily available and used for the formation of smectite and illite, thus the ash beds are mainly\\ncomposed of smectite in the early stage and subsequently dominated by illite due to the illitization\\nof smectite [50,51]. Although the mineralogy and chemistry of the clay minerals that form could be\\ninﬂuenced by the variations of burial conditions, the volcanic ash is usually altered into smectite in\\nsubaqueous environments [49,52,53]. In this study, the clay minerals mainly consist of illite (86%),\\nwith minor R3 ordering illite/smectite (13%), and chlorite (1%). The clay minerals of Li-rich clays\\nsample TL-1 and TL-2 from Tongliang section completely comprise I/S, while the sample TL-3 is\\nmainly composed of R3 ordered I/S (68%), illite (24%) and chlorite (5%) [2]. Generally, the I/S in\\nK-bentonite is considered to alter from the smectite during diagenesis, whereas smectite is mainly\\nformed by submarine alteration of volcanic materials [52,54]. The illitization of smectite begins at\\nabout 70~80\\nC and leads to a decrease in the percentage of smectite in this process, which is usually\\ncharacterized by the following reaction sequence: smectite→randomly interstratiﬁed illite-smectite\\nmixed layer (I-S)→ordered I-S→illite [55,56]. Although the composition and permeability of the parent\\nash seems to be the principal controlling factor in the illitization rates of smectite, it appears that other\\nimportant factors could have inﬂuenced the reaction, such as the burial temperature and time, as well\\nas the chemistry of porewaters (especially K+ content) [56,57]. The characteristics of mixed layer I/S\\nclay minerals are signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the deposition facies and porewater K concentrations [58].\\nThe mixed-layer R3 ordered I/S derived from the smectite illitization of a volcanic ash bed observed in\\nthis study is probably attributed to deep burial and elevated alteration temperatures [59,60], while\\nthe poorly ordered (R0) mixed-layered I/S is usually attributed to a low burial temperature [61].\\nThe temperatures and depth of post-sedimentary alteration reached by the sediments during the\\nburial diagenesis history could be reliably estimated by the proportion of smectite layers in I/S [58].\\nThe percent of smectite in I/S of the Li-rich K-bentonite is around 15%, suggesting that the temperatures\\nof thermal evolution reached by the sediments are approximately 180\\nC [55,62]. Based on the\\nC/km in the Sichuan basin, the burial depth\\nassumption of an average geothermal gradient of 30\\ncalculated for the Early–Middle Triassic Li-rich K-bentonites corresponds to around 6 km. The Eu/Eu*\\nvalues of eruptive volcanic ashes are initially dependent on the growth of magmatic plagioclase, and the\\nEu generally tends not to fractionate relative to other REEs during the transport and deposition, except\\nthat it can easily be changed in a reducing diagenetic environment.

South of the recharge area, the\\nsandstone is conformably overlain by Cretaceous sandstone. The gently dipping (5˝ to 10˝) contact\\namong the cap rock-strata establishes the aquifer’s northern boundary. General groundwater ﬂow\\ndirections in the regional Carboniferous volcanic and basin-ﬁll aquifers, shown in Figure 1, illustrate\\nthe potential groundwater ﬂow paths for waters discharging in the basin, and are strongly inﬂuenced\\nby basin-and-range-style linear mountain ranges and piedmont alluvial fan, as well as by the general\\ndecrease in surface elevations from the south to the north. The hydro-stratigraphy of the basin includes\\nmany of the units described by the Northwest Institute of Uranium Geology [22]. The Proterozoic and\\nCarboniferous stratigraphic units comprise the lower aquifer. Those units are complexly fractured and\\nthe fractures are believed to have enhanced hydraulic connectivity. Much of the Mesozoic stratigraphy\\nforms a regional sandstone aquifer. Jurassic mudstone and coal stratigraphy may locally be aquifers,\\nbut generally form barriers and aquitards to groundwater ﬂow. Uppermost Tertiary and Quaternary\\nalluvial basin-ﬁll deposits comprise the regional basin-ﬁll aquifer. Groundwater ﬂow in the regional\\nsandstone and basin-ﬁll aquifers is commonly hydrologically connected throughout much of the\\nsouthwestern Tuha basin. Most of the recharge for the regional aquifer is from the mountainous\\nregions south of the basin and, partially, from snowmelt water on the Bogeda Mountain in the north\\nof the basin [22]. The Jiaoluotage Mountain range along the southern margin of the basin produces\\nsufﬁcient moisture for groundwater recharge to occur in the basin. The climate across the Tuha basin is\\narid with a mean annual precipitation of approximately 17 mm. The annual evapotranspiration there,\\nhowever, is more than 3000 mm. The mean annual temperature is 13.9 ˝C and the highest temperature\\nin the summer reaches 50 ˝C, the highest temperature in China. Given the low precipitation to\\nevapotranspiration ratio, recharge into the aquifer from direct inﬁltration of rainfall precipitation is\\nsmall. Discharge of groundwater occurs primarily through natural springs and Lake Aiting. Most of\\nthe larger discharge springs emanate from either the Carboniferous intermediate-acidic volcanic and\\nvolcaniclastic rocks (Spring 2 or sample 2, Table 1) around the margin of the basin or from Quaternary\\nrocks within the basin (Spring 1 or sample 1). Lake Aiting with an elevation of ´155 m is the lowest\\npoint of elevation in continental China. Water ﬂows through porous sandstones via a network of\\nfractures from the outcrop region in the southwest, toward Aiting Lake in the northeast (Figure 1).\\nThe present ﬂow direction of surface water and groundwater in the horizontal plane is from southwest\\nto northeast. The basin is a discharge area for regional groundwater ﬂow. The major and trace element\\nchemistry of the groundwater is reported in Min et al. [22].\\n\n",

Polymorphic layers\\nare comprised of clay minerals, residual organic material, bacterial cells, and secondary Au structures.\\nThese layers often occur within crevices, which is to say, topographically-low regions, at the surface of\\nAu particles [64,66,67,78]. Secondary Au structures are nanometer–micrometer-scale features that occur\\non Au particles. With increasing sophistication of electron microscopes, the characterization of these\\nsecondary Au structures has greatly improved, thereby providing a better understanding of Au-particle\\ntransformation. Secondary Au structures can be broadly categorized into two groups, based on the\\nprocesses that contribute to their formation: Au/Ag dissolution and Au reprecipitation. It is the\\nbalance between these two, biogeochemical processes that drives the cycling of Au and contributes to\\nthe transformation of Au particles. The solubilization of Au and Ag from Au particles (for example,\\nby dealloying or (bacterially-catalyzed) solubilization) leads to the formation of dissolution features\\nwhich include striations, porous structures, and bacteriomorphic Au [62,66,67,77,79,80]. These features\\nare attributed to (bio)geochemical-dissolution processes, as striations often occur along Au crystal\\nboundaries [80]. Bacteriomorphic Au also contains a crystalline fabric, containing both Au and\\nAg, which is reminiscent of the primary material [66]. As previously mentioned, dissolved Au\\noccurs as soluble-Au complexes that can be directly reduced by bacteria or other organic/inorganic\\nreductants, to form pure, Au0 nanoparticles. While these nanoparticles often appear quasi-spherical\\nin shape, they are actually nanophase crystals. At micrometer-scales, euhedral crystals are more\\nclearly-deﬁned and variability in structures is apparent, as shown in Figure 2. It is important to keep\\nin mind that Au-dissolution processes, acting on a Au particle, can also act upon Au nanoparticles,\\nthereby increasing structural variability. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that, with increased\\nAu solubilization from an Au particle, subsequent reduction of the soluble complex will either form\\nmore abundant nanoparticles or allow nanoparticles to grow in size. Additionally, secondary Au\\nstructures can be physically altered during mechanical re-shaping, which suggests a balance between\\n(bio)geochemical and mechanical weathering processes. Therefore, secondary Au structures are\\nrelicts—physical evidence of past, biogeochemical processes that have transformed particle surfaces\\nand have attributed, in part, to the activity of microbes [61,66,67,77,81], as shown in Figure 3.\\nInterestingly, Au particles that exhibited a greater extent of transformation also contained bioﬁlms\\nwith a more-specialized, metal-tolerant, microbial community [61,67]. Though Au is conventionally\\nconsidered an inert metal, the interaction between microbes and Au particles highlights not only an\\ninﬂuence of bacteria on Au-particle-structure and chemistry, but on microbial diversity as well, with\\nregards increased resistance to Au toxicity.\\n\n",

(b) 231Pa/230Th time series from ODP site 1063 (see also Figure 4), indicates\\nvariations in the strength of the Atlantic Overturning Circulation (AMOC) [40]. This 231Pa/230Th-based\\nreconstruction of the vigour of the AMOC shows that the AMOC-strength is greatly reduced during\\nHeinrich stadials (HS) (blue shaded bars), especially during HS1 and HS2, when the AMOC is in its off\\nmode. (c) Sea-surface temperature (SST) reconstruction from the Alboran Sea, show pronounced SST\\nchanges associated with Heinrich and DO stadials. Western Amazonia (WA) speleothem δ18O time\\nseries include speleothems from (d) El Condor (ELC-A*, ELC-B*), (e) Cueva del Diamante (NAR-C*,\\nNAR-D*, NAR-F*) [16] and (f) Pacupahuain Cave [27]. (g) Speleothem δ18O time series from eastern\\nAmazonia (EA) are from Paraiso Cave (PAR01, PAR03, PAR06, PAR07, PAR08, PAR16, PAR24) [29].\\n(h) Speleothem δ18O time series from Eastern Brazil (EB) include stalagmites from Lapa Sem Fim\\nCave (LSF3, LSF9, LSF11, LSF13, LSF15, LSF16) and Lapa Grande Cave (LG10, LG12, LG25) [24,25].\\n(i) Speleothems from northeastern Brazil (NEB) are from Paixão Cave (PX7) and Marota Gigante\\nCave (MAG) [24,25]. (j) The speleothem δ18O time series from Rio Grande do Norte (Nordeste) is\\ncomposed of stalagmites from Rainha Cave (RN1, RN4), Abissal Cave (Abisal, Ale-1) and Furna Nova\\nCave (FN1) [8].

The error bars show the 2-sigma age\\nuncertainty of individual U-Th ages for all stalagmites. Temporal uncertainties for isotope values were\\nnot available.\\nComparison of the western Amazonia δ18O time series during MIS 3 (Figure 6d–f) indicates that\\nprecipitation amounts in WA were higher during Northern Hemisphere (NH) cold events compared\\nto the following DOs. An exception from this is the precipitation response to HS2. HS2 is almost\\nas pronounced as HS1 in the 231Pa/230Th record (Figure 6b) and should have caused a distinct\\nprecipitation response in WA. However, precipitation changes are modest at the beginning of HS2\\nand peak at its termination, shortly before the AMOC returns from its off-mode into its cold-mode\\n(Figure 6d–f). What is also evident in the δ18O time series from Pacupahuain Cave is the increasing\\nprecipitation associated with the evolution of DO12. This pattern is less clearly pronounced in the two\\nδ18O time series from El Condor Cave (Figure 6d) and absent in the record from Cueva del Diamate\\n(Figure 6e). The latter is likely caused by the low temporal resolution of this record at the time of\\nDO12 (Figure 6e). During MIS 3 similar responses as for the WA δ18O time series are observed for\\neastern Amazonia (Figure 6g), eastern Brazil (Figure 6h), and northeastern Brazil (Figure 6i). The\\nspeleothem δ18O time series from Rio Grande do Norte (Figure 6j) covers only the end of HS2 in MIS 3\\nbut is consistent with the other stalagmite δ18O time series, indicating a trend from wetter to dryer\\nconditions. In central Brazil precipitation changes during HS2 are coherent with the other regions\\ninﬂuenced by the SAMS, indicating that distinct precipitation changes occurred only during the end\\nof HS2. The speleothem δ18O time series from Botuverá Cave has a very low temporal resolution\\nand large age uncertainties during MIS 3 (Figure 6l), which makes it difﬁcult to identify HS and DOs\\nin this record. However, some of Heinrich and DO stadials match quite well with this record and\\nwhen considering the ﬁndings from other speleothems from this cave [11,12], inferring precipitation\\nincreases during HS, the emerging ﬁgure is that precipitation amounts at Botuverá Cave increased\\nduring HS and decreased during DOs.\\n\n",

The response in rainfall amount during MIS 3 across the SAMS domain suggests\\nthat the development of a Mega-SACZ is not only restricted to HS1 but is present and even more\\npronounced during all Heinrich stadials in MIS 3. Moreover, the speleothem and travertine growth\\nperiods from northeastern Brazil, dating back 220 kyrs, suggest the development of the Mega-SACZ\\nbefore the Eemian (MIS 5e, c. 130 kyrs BP to 115 kyrs BP) [45]. Testing this hypothesis requires\\nthe generation of new high-resolution (<30 years) speleothem δ18O time series covering the last\\n120 kyrs from the region. Strengthening of the cross-equatorial heat transport, related to changes\\nin sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical Atlantic, are thought to drive the development\\nof the Mega-SACZ [25]. This is consistent with modelling experiments investigating the effect of\\na mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere cooling through an AMOC shutdown, which would drive\\nchanges in SSTs in the tropical Atlantic [47]. Chiang and others (2012) [47] suggest dry conditions\\nshould prevail in northeast Brazil during an AMOC shutdown, however, this is not consistent with\\nthe speleothem-based rainfall reconstructions presented discussed here (Figure 6j). It is not clear why\\nmodelling and the palaeoclimate reconstructions exhibit opposite precipitation trends in response to\\nHeinrich stadials (NH cooling); further work is necessary to resolve this apparent discrepancy between\\nmodels and observations, and highlights Nordeste as a key region for data-model comparisons.\\nCompared to the precipitation response during Heinrich and DO stadials in MIS 3, the precipitation\\nvariability during HS1 is different in the domain of the SAMS (Figure 6). This is particulary the\\ncase in western Amazonia where precipitation amounts progressively decrease (Figure 6e,f) while\\nprecipitation amounts in the other regions increase; except eastern Amazonia, where no speleothem\\nδ18O time series is available. Kanner et al. (2012) [27] noted an inﬂunce of Southern Hemisphere (SH)\\nhigh latitude climate variability on precipitation changes at Pacupahuain Cave during the Antarctic\\nIsotope Maxima 8 (40 to 37 kyrs BP) and 12 (48.5 to 46 kyrs BP). A similar high-latitude inﬂuence on\\nprecipitation amounts in the northern realm of the SAMS domain could also explain the apparent\\ndifferences between the WA speleothem δ18O time series and the other Brazilian δ18O time series. With\\nthe beginning of HS1 in the NH, reconstructed Antarctic temperaures increase until about 14 kyrs\\nBP [48]. Therefore, the opposite hemispheric temperature trends, a cooling NH associated with HS1\\nand a warming SH, strengthened the inter-hemispheric temperature contrast, which, based on energetic\\nconstrains [1,44,47], provokes a southward shift of the ITCZ (similar to the arguments in Section 3.1.1),\\nin turn, shifting and/or tilting SAMS precipitation pattern. This would causes a precipitation decrease\\nin western Amazonia. In summary, the precipitation variability of the SAMS from 50 kyrs BP until\\nthe end of the YD is heavily dependent on the high-latitude NH climate variablity associated with\\nNH cold events (Heinrich stadials) and DOs, respectively. The emerging pattern during MIS 3 is that\\nprecipitation amounts were higher during NH cold events compared to DOs. Modest precipitation\\nchanges are observed during HS2 and this is unexpected when considering the observed precipitation\\nincrease to HS in MIS 3. However, one explaination for this can be, that HS2 is not followed by a DO,\\nwhile all other NH cold events in MIS 3 are followed by a DO (Figure 6a–c). This may have weakened\\nthe response of the SAMS and precipitation changes to HS.\\n\n",

The region spans the transition between a temperate\\nMediterranean climate in the Levant to hyper-arid sub-tropical deserts in the south, with complex\\nalpine topography in the northeast feeding the Euphrates and Tigris rivers which support life in the\\nSoutheastern FC (Figure 1). Climate projections predict severe drying in major parts of the ME in\\nresponse to global climate change, with a considerable impact for societies [3–5]. Climate reconstructions\\nand archaeological information, suggest that changes in the regional hydroclimate was a primary driver\\nin human expansion out of Africa [6], the Neolithic revolution, and the development of the ﬁrst complex\\nsocieties [7]. The ME has plentiful archeological records of human settlement throughout much of\\nthe Quaternary, and well into the Holocene [8–14]. Initially, the predominantly semi to hyper-arid\\nclimate of the region served as a bottle-neck for early hominin dispersion out of Africa, allowing\\nmigrations onto the Levant and the AP pathways only during wetter periods that were identiﬁed\\nusing speleothem growth (wet)/non-growth (dry) patterns in desert and water-limited settings [15–18].\\nThese events are also recognized using other methods and diﬀerent climate archives [10,19,20]. Since\\nthe Last Glacial Maximum from c. 25 to 20 ka BP (Before Present, calibrated in the SISAL database\\nto the year 1950 of the Common Era, hereafter CE) and the following transition into the Holocene\\ninterglacial, there has been considerable evidence that variations in climate served as a driver in\\nHomo Sapiens’ cultural evolution. The most notable is the “Neolithic Revolution”, where it has been\\nsuggested that post-glacial hunter-gatherers were able to cultivate a number of food plants due to the\\ntrend towards warmer and possibly wetter climate [21], whereas succeeding abrupt cooling events\\nmay have forced proto-agrarian societies to turn to the cultivation of wild cereals and fruit [21–23].\\nWheat was cultivated in the FC around 9500 years BP, suggesting that the ME was the ﬁrst region to\\ncultivate plants and support sedentary human communities [24,25]. The ME localities, speciﬁcally the\\nFC, were also the earliest locations where sophisticated civilizations, city-states and complex empire\\nsystems appeared during the mid- to late-Holocene [26,27]. It has been argued that the expansion and\\nsubsequent collapse of these civilizations was partly driven by rapid climate change events [14,28–32]\\nsuperimposed on more gradual millennial climatic shifts. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested\\nan association between a contemporary increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts in recent\\ndecades, to geopolitical unrest in the region, e.g., the Syrian Civil War [29,33,34]. These correlations\\nhighlight the importance of understanding both past and future climate perturbations in the ME.\\nThis can be achieved by use of large spatio-temporal networks/datasets of terrestrial hydro-climate\\narchives. Regional-scale coherency would greatly improve our understanding of past variations in the\\nspatio-temporal precipitation pattern of the ME, thereby resolving some of the contradictions between\\ndiﬀerent records in the region [1,35].\\n\n",

However, the paleoclimatic interpretation of Chinese speleothem\\nδ18O records remains an issue of debate [16,181–193]. For example, there is a strong correlation\\nbetween speleothem δ18O series in the EASM and ISM regions, but these data contrast with some\\nother Chinese rainfall records reconstructed by loess and lake sediments [181,182,188]. A few studies\\nsuggest that Chinese speleothem δ18O variability is not controlled by rainfall amount but by moisture\\nsource [181,182] or pathway [192], while others conclude that they are not only inﬂuenced by the EASM\\nbut also to a signiﬁcant extent by winter temperature [184,185]. Instrumental data and paleoclimatic\\nreconstructions based on other natural archives imply a spatial distribution of rainfall over eastern\\nChina that is not consistent with the observations from speleothem δ18O records. In this regard,\\nLiu et al. [189] argued that speleothem δ18O records in the region cannot be used as an indicator of\\nEASM intensity. These disagreements partially arose from diﬀering deﬁnitions of “ASM intensity”.\\nChinese speleothem δ18O records, particularly on orbital to millennial scales, reﬂect ﬁrst order changes\\nin the fraction of water vapor rained out between tropical sources and cave sites (e.g., [1,12,50]). By this\\ndeﬁnition, a strong ASM implies a more remote moisture source, with larger rainout along the moisture\\ntrajectory, and thus lighter speleothem δ18O values (e.g., [12]). On orbital scales, this observation is\\nreproducible because Chinese speleothem records follow the NHSI, but their relation to regional rainfall\\namount remains in dispute [181,182,188,189,193]. Regarding large millennial-scale events, speleothem\\nδ18O records show consistent positive excursions (i.e., weak EASM) corresponding to cold events\\nthat occurred in NH high latitudes. However, the associated spatial changes in rainfall in the EASM\\ndomain could have some regional diﬀerences, as suggested by model simulations (e.g., [186,194,195]),\\nand as of yet, very limited and diﬃcult to interpret observational data (e.g., [14,196]). The spatial\\ndistribution of rainfall in monsoonal China is primarily controlled by changes in the position of the\\nmonsoonal rainfall belt in response to changes in EASM intensity coupled with some geographic\\nconsiderations. It has been suggested that a weak EASM (i.e., consistent positive δ18O values in the\\nmonsoonal China) leads to a southward shift of the rain belt that in turn results in either a dipole (i.e.,\\ndry northern China and a wet southern China [44,122,151]) or a tripole pattern (i.e., dry northern and\\nsouthern China but wet in Central China [14]). Therefore, the speleothem δ18O records ultimately show\\nthe integrated monsoonal signal from the moisture source to the cave sites on orbital to millennial\\ntimescales [1], in line with modeling results (e.g., [191,194,197,198]). In this sense, the longstanding\\ndisparity between interpretations of Chinese cave δ18O records may be resolvable through a thorough\\ninvestigation of site-speciﬁc controls on speleothem δ18O and/or independently corroborating records\\nof rainfall intensity.\\n\n",

Here, we utilize some of these\\nrecords to compare and put the carbon and oxygen isotope compositions and growth rate information\\nfrom Korallgrottan in a broader paleoclimatic context. The focus of our comparison is on (1) the\\ntiming of the commencement of growth at ~130 ka; (2) the time around 127.3 ka when growth rate\\nincreased along with rapidly shifting but overall negative δ18O values; and (3) the period of relatively\\nless negative δ18O values between ~126.77 and ~125.68 ka, in Kf-21.\\nin the Austrian Alps\\n(Figure 1), ice-free, warmer, and wetter conditions are indicated from 134.1 ± 0.7 ka by the deposition\\nof speleothems [32]. A rapid change towards less negative δ18O values in stalagmites from these caves\\nat 130.9 ± 0.9 ka (Figure 5C,D) suggests rapidly increasing temperatures in the region and a northward\\ndisplacement of the polar front [32]. The timing of this shift is in good agreement with the onset\\nof the deposition of Kf-21. There are also several other similarities between the δ18O records from\\nSchneckenloch Cave and from Korallgrottan; for instance, there is a good agreement between warmer\\nconditions interpreted from the less negative δ18O values observed in Schneckenloch Cave from ~127.1 to\\n~126.8 ka and more negative δ18O values in Korallgrottan from ~127.23 to ~126.77 ka. These intervals\\nare then followed by colder conditions in both caves indicated by more negative δ18O values between\\n~126.8 and ~125.6 ka in Schneckenloch Cave and less negative δ18O values between ~126.77 and ~125.68 ka\\nin Korallgrottan (Figure 5). To the east, growth of stalagmite BAR-II from Baradla Cave in northeast\\nHungary suggests that temperature and humidity conditions were suitable for speleothem formation\\nfrom ~129 ka [31]. Carbon isotope compositions in stalagmite BAR-II show that interglacial conditions\\ngradually developed from ~128 ka (Figure 5B), and that the period from ~127 to ~123 ka was one of higher\\nhumidity before full interglacial conditions were reached at ~124 ka [31]. The onset of the period of higher\\nhumidity in Baradla fits well with the start of more rapid growth and warmer conditions recorded in\\nnorthwest Sweden. In Baradla Cave, a period of more negative δ13C values in the interval of 126.8 to\\n125.7 ka coincides with the less negative δ18O values in Korallgrottan between ~126.77 and ~125.68 ka.\\nTo the west, the formation of stalagmite BD-inf between ~128 and ~121 ka in Bourgeois-Delaunay Cave\\n(western France) coincides with the warmest part of the LIG, and the most negative δ18O values occur\\nat ~127.7 ka (Figure 5E, [33]). The high-resolution δ18O record from this cave suggests millennial-scale\\nclimate variability during the period from ~128 to ~121 ka, with several periods of drier conditions\\nindicated by less negative δ18O values, interrupting the overall wetter and warmer climate. One of the\\ndrier periods occurs between ~126.3 and ~125.3 ka, closely coinciding with the interval of colder climate\\nconditions recorded in Korallgrottan between ~126.77 and ~125.68 ka (Figure 5A,E).\\n\n",

At present, we have an\\ninadequate understanding regarding the relationships between Quaternary permafrost distribution\\nand vegetation patterns, such as those of permafrost evolution with deserts or sandlands. Additionally,\\nwhat are the relationships between lakes and permafrost, as during the Quaternary? There were many\\nlarge and persistent lakes in China during glacial and interglacial periods. In particular, the paleo-lakes\\nin the source area of the Yellow river and their outbursts or interconnections during the Gong’he\\nMovement coinciding with the ending of the Penultimate Glaciations or connections of smaller basins\\non northeastern QTP at the end of the LGM might have created the upper Yellow River basin and shifted\\nthe headwaters of the Yellow River toward the east. In addition, the formation and disintegration\\nof the Tianshuihai-Akseqin Lakes on the western QTP during the last 70 ka have great impacts on\\nplateau permafrost and periglacial environments, but were seldom studied. Substantial changes in sea\\nlevel may also have greatly aﬀected Quaternary permafrost in China, because during the cold periods\\nof lower sea levels, many continental shelves of eastern and southern China seas were extensively\\nexposed to the chilly climate and the arctic fronts at much southerly positions, or even closed into\\ninland basins (e.g., [170]). Could some exposed continental shelves have been frozen for a long-term,\\nas some cold climate paleo-fauna and -ﬂora fossils have been unearthed by drilling or excavations in\\nEastern China seas? Many thermokarst lakes and pingos (or pingo scars), as well as (buried) palsas,\\nlithalsas, and peat blankets or plateaus, have been reported on the QTP, in alpine regions in West China\\nand in the northern part of Northeast China. However, their formation and evolutionary processes and\\ntheir relationships with past permafrost remain poorly investigated and largely unknown. How about\\nthe buried and multi-layered permafrost being formed now and during the diﬀerent warm periods\\nof the Quaternary, especially during the numerous interglacials? How to classify and map their\\ndistribution under a warming and cooling climate? How would they impact the alpine ecosystems\\nand hydrology–hydrogeology, as well as engineering geology, and the ecosystems and socio-economic\\nsituation downstream? Additionally, there are large knowledge gaps regarding spatial and temporal\\nrelationships of permafrost and periglacial development and distribution during the Quaternary\\nand each stage at the borders of China and neighboring countries or regions. Can the results be\\nseamlessly or unanimously matched or merged regionally and globally? These inter-comparisons\\nand cross-examinations may greatly advance studies on Quaternary geocryology and geology and\\ninternational cooperation in Eurasia and the northern hemisphere.\\n\n",
       "307  The sharp contact between the calcareous gyttja and the overlaying dark brown silty/sandy\\ngyttja could indicate erosion. However, the diﬀerence in macroscopic content of the two layers,\\ntogether with the 14C-dates, suggests only a limited hiatus and minor reworking of the calcareous\\ngyttja (Table 2, Figure 7). Three macrofossil samples were collected from this dark brown gyttja,\\nand it is possibly contemporary with the earliest traces of occupation in the area. The sand content\\nis higher in the dark brown gyttja than in the calcareous gyttja, with the highest concentrations\\nin the lowermost and uppermost part (86.25 and 86.75 m a.s.l.), indicating higher energy in the\\nwater (Figure 5). Plant macrofossils in the lower part of this layer are dated to 8200–7700 cal BC\\n(Figure 7), and it is likely that the material was accumulated in Ancient Lake Vättern (ALV), after its\\ntransgression over Lake Strandvägen, probably shortly after ca. 8000 cal BC. This interpretation of\\nALV incursion is chronologically supported by the complete absence of Tilia pollen, as the ALV brings\\nhigh concentrations of e.g., Betula-, Corylus- and Juniperus pollen into the small basin, and drown local\\nshoreline shrubs such as Hippophäe and Salix (Figure 6). The plant macrofossils in the dark brown gyttja\\nare dominated by species which commonly occur in the Mesolithic contexts at the site [9,34], and lack\\ntraces of the younger ﬂora with meadow and weed vegetation, which characterize the medieval- and\\nIron age material at adjacent sites. The occurrence of elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) and raspberry\\n(Rubus idaeus L.) in the lower part of the gyttja may reﬂect Mesolithic gathering or the local ﬂora.\\nThis interpretation is strengthened by the pollen ﬂora, which contains early Holocene elderberry [35].\\nIn e.g., the Czech Republic, elderberry has been found in Mesolithic archaeological contexts [60], but in\\nScandinavia, the earliest ﬁnds of seeds so far seem to be from the Middle Neolithic in Denmark [61].\\nSmall amounts of charcoal occur in the middle and lower parts of the dark brown gyttja, possibly\\nderiving from a contemporary occupation. The lowermost part of the unit is a coarse-detrital gyttja\\nwhich is ﬁning upwards from ca. 86.4 m a.s.l. This combination of changes in sand content, macrofossils\\nand pollen are interpreted as a successive rise in the water level, leading to greater distance to the\\nshore (Figures 5–7). Alternatively, the sediment could also be explained by reworking caused by a\\nyounger ﬂuvial event, but the lack of plant macrofossils and pollen typical for the younger periods\\n(e.g., Picea and Tilia pollen) make this unlikely. At 86.5 m a.s.l., the sediment is a ﬁne-detrital gyttja\\nwith low sand content and high amounts of Chara sp. macrospores (oospores), indicating deeper\\nwater conditions (Figure 5). We interpret this sediment as deposited during the highest stand of\\nALV, reported to be 92.5 m a.s.l. by [27]. This would indicate that the local water depth at this time\\nwas at most six meters, which is very plausible, considering the micro- and macroscopic content.\\nAt 86.69 m a.s.l., a two cm sandy layer contains the lowermost distinct charcoal horizon (>20 frag.),\\nand the charcoal is, because of the high concentration, most likely of anthropogenic origin. This level\\ncan be interpolated to be 7500–7000 cal BC (Figure 7), and probably reﬂect the ﬁrst fall in water level in\\nthe Vättern basin, as River Motala Ström is formed, causing a sudden regression. It is unclear if the\\ngyttja only contains material deposited in ALV, or if some of the organic material may be reworked\\nfrom the substratum of calcareous gyttja. It is noteworthy that a part of the organic material seems to\\noriginate from occupational waste, not only elderberries and a high amount of charcoal, but also ﬁsh\\nscales and fruits of ﬂoating sweet grass (Glyceria ﬂutans L.) In Scandinavia, this tasty water grass is\\nrecorded as collected food during the Middle Neolithic and later, e.g., in Alvastra Pile dwelling [62].\\nIn the uppermost part (ca. 86.7–86.8 m a.s.l.), the unit is again a sandy coarse-detrital gyttja, which\\nmay reﬂect a lowering of the water level, causing the shore to move closer with its vegetation of reeds\\n(Phragmites australis L.) and rush (Schoenoplectus lacustris Palla). The lowering of the water table is\\nconnected to the channel erosion and successive down-cutting of River Motala Ström, during the ﬁrst\\nregression event in Lake Vättern. The ﬁrst Tilia-pollen appears in the uppermost part of the dark brown\\ngyttja (coarse-detrital gyttja at 86.77 m a.s.l.), which dates it to ca. 6200 cal BC or later [19], although\\nthe pollen grains appear to be corroded, which might indicate some redeposition.\\n\n",

(2012),\\nJiménez et al. (2012), García-Moreno et al. (2013), Ro-\\nbichaud et al. (2013), Lieskovský and Kenderessy (2014)\\nand Martins et al. (2014), the effects of the study scale on\\nthe effectiveness of various mulch covers have rarely been\\nconsidered. There are a few studies about the spatial-scale\\nvariations in mulches on runoff and soil loss. Poesen et\\nal. (1994) reviewed the effects of rock fragments on soil ero-\\nsion and stated that the spatial scale has an important impact\\non the soil erosion. They showed that, on the microplot scale\\n(4 mm2 to 1 m2), sediment yield reached a maximum value\\nwith 0 % rock fragment cover and reached a minimum value\\nwith 100 % rock fragment cover. On the mesoplot scale (i.e.,\\ninterrill areas), negative, positive as well as convex upward\\nrelationships with cover percentages have been observed, de-\\npending on the ﬁne-earth structure, on the vertical position\\nin the topsoil, on the size of rock fragments and on the sur-\\nface slope. Finally, on the macroplot scale (i.e., interrill and\\nrill areas; 10–10 000 m2), sediment yield decreased exponen-\\ntially with rock fragment cover. Cerdan et al. (2002) investi-\\ngated the scale effect (plot to catchment) on runoff in agricul-\\ntural areas of Normandy, France. Three databases – 450 m2\\nplots, a 90 ha catchment and an 1100 ha catchment – were\\nselected to collect runoff data. Between the three scales, a\\nsigniﬁcant decrease in the runoff coefﬁcient was observed as\\nthe area increased. Mingguo et al. (2007) also studied the ef-\\nfect of vegetation on the runoff–sediment-yield relationship\\non different spatial scales (plot to watershed) in hilly areas\\nof the Loess Plateau, northern China, and found that vegeta-\\ntion could reduce runoff and soil loss on both scales but that,\\non a plot scale, the reduction rate of sediment was more than\\nthe runoff. Smets et al. (2008a) reviewed the impact of plot\\nlength on the effectiveness of different soil surface covers\\nin reducing runoff and soil loss. The results indicated that,\\nfor plot lengths < 11 m, there was a large variation in the\\nrunoff and erosion-reducing effectiveness of each soil cover,\\ndepending on various factors. Smets et al. (2008b) also exam-\\nined the spatial-scale effects on the effectiveness of organic\\nmulches in reducing soil erosion in ﬁeld and laboratory ex-\\nperiments (plot length ranges between 0.1 and 30.5 m). Re-\\nsults veriﬁed the effectiveness of mulches in reducing soil\\nerosion by water on various scales. In addition, they showed\\na positive linear relation between the erosion-reducing ef-\\nfectiveness of an organic mulch cover and plot length. In\\nshort plots, the response of a soil surface cover to runoff and\\nsoil loss was immediately observed. Nevertheless, on longer\\nplots, the runoff and soil loss response could be compensated\\nfor due to the longer plot length. Fernández et al. (2012)\\nstudied the seeding and the mulching and seeding effects on\\npost-ﬁre runoff and soil erosion in Galicia (NW Spain), with\\na rainfall rate of 67 mm h−1 at plot scale. They showed that\\nthe conserved treatments did not signiﬁcantly increase soil\\n\n",

The isotopic signal of the cementing ﬂuids may have\\nbeen buffered by interaction with the host rock (dissolution\\nof detrital marine shells in the sandstone framework; e.g.,\\nFig. 10c–d), by mixing with local formation water (McBride\\net al., 1995), or, for instance, by more regional factors (e.g.,\\natmospheric temperature, humidity, precipitation, seasonal-\\nity of precipitation and recharge, vegetation; Cortecci et al.,\\n2008; Jasechko, 2019). In this view, further investigations\\nwould be needed to properly constrain the cementing ﬂuid\\nconditions (e.g., clumped isotopes, ﬂuid inclusions). The\\nδ13C composition of cement (Fig. 12a), however, seems to\\nreﬂect soil weathering processes as the primary source of\\nbicarbonate dissolved in the waters (Hudson, 1977; Nelson\\nand Smith, 1996) and supports precipitation from meteoric\\nﬂuids. DB-parallel and bedding-parallel nodules show a sim-\\nilar composition for δ18O; however, bedding-parallel nodules\\nhave more depleted δ13C values. This might reﬂect a higher\\ncontribution of organic carbon from soil-derived CO2 (Hud-\\nson, 1977), possibly indicating that bedding-parallel nodules\\nformed in shallower conditions with respect to DB-parallel\\nnodules. Another explanation is that the two types of nodules\\nwere formed by different episodes of water inﬂow with dif-\\nferent (external) environmental conditions. The difference in\\nisotopic composition between these two types of nodules in-\\ndeed suggests different cement precipitation timing and wa-\\nter compositions as proposed by McBride et al. (1995) and\\nMilliken et al. (1998). Phreatic meteoric conditions for nod-\\nule formation point to a shallow diagenesis, and it is consis-\\ntent with the shallow burial depths estimated for the Loiano\\nSandstones (see Sect. 7.1).\\n\n",

In the geothermal domain, such projects constitute\\nexpensive experiments and thus are relatively few in num-\\nber, whereas, in the oil and gas domain, where hydro-fracture\\noperations are frequent and routine, the data tend to be pro-\\nprietary. Nevertheless, some notable datasets have been ac-\\nquired for deep brine injection projects (Ake et al., 2005;\\nBlock et al., 2015), deep scientiﬁc drilling projects such as\\nthe German KTB project (Zoback and Harjes, 1997; Em-\\nmermann and Lauterjung, 1997; Jost et al., 1998; Baisch\\nand Harjes, 2003), and hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas\\nproduction enhancement (Warpinski, 2009; Das and Zoback,\\n2011; Dusseault et al., 2011; Pettitt et al., 2011; Vermylen\\nand Zoback, 2011; Boroumand and Eaton, 2012; van der\\nBaan et al., 2013; Bao and Eaton, 2016) and during the stim-\\nulation of deep geothermal boreholes (Parker, 1989; Jupe et\\nal., 1992; Cornet and Scotti, 1993; Tezuka and Niitsuma,\\n2000; Asanuma et al., 2005; Evans et al., 2005a; Häring et\\nal., 2008; Brown et al., 2012; Baisch et al., 2015). Well-\\ndocumented hydraulic stimulation datasets generally include\\nmicroseismic observations as well as injection pressures and\\nﬂow rates and, occasionally, tilt monitoring (Evans, 1983;\\nWarpinski and Teufel, 1997). Although much information\\ncan be gained from these datasets, including imaging of\\nmicroseismic structures (Niitsuma et al., 1999; Maxwell,\\n2014), energy balance between injected ﬂuids and seismic\\nenergy release (Boroumand and Eaton 2012; Zoback et al.,\\n2012; Warpinski, 2013), and source mechanisms (Jupe et al.,\\n1992; Deichmann and Ernst, 2009; Warpinski and Du, 2010;\\nHorálek et al., 2010), the constraints placed on the processes\\nare insufﬁcient to resolve details of the hydromechanical pro-\\ncesses that underpin permeability enhancement, ﬂow-path\\nlinkage, channeling or the interaction with natural fractures.\\nMany of these processes possibly also depend on rock type.\\nFor instance, case studies analyzed by Evans et al. (2012)\\nsupport the notion that injection into sedimentary rock tends\\nto be less seismogenic than in crystalline rock. Moreover, it\\nis likely that a signiﬁcant part of the permeability creation\\nprocesses take place in an aseismic manner (Cornet et al.,\\n1997; Evans, 1998; Guglielmi et al., 2015b; Zoback et al.,\\n2012), implying that seismic monitoring may only illuminate\\nparts of the stimulated rock volume. In many deep hydraulic\\nstimulation projects the rock mass is only accessed by one\\nor at most a few boreholes, and the structural and geologi-\\ncal models of the reservoir are not well deﬁned. In general,\\nthe displacements on fractures arising from the injection can\\nonly be directly measured where they intersect the boreholes,\\nand deformation occurring within the rock mass is poorly re-\\nsolved.\\n\n",

Although not shown in the diagram, us-\\ning a limestone-buffered δ13CVPDB (∼ 1 ‰) predicts values\\nthat are not consistent with any of the observed data, and this\\nsuggests that an external source of CO2 may be most appro-\\npriate for veins in both the carbonate and siliciclastic host\\nrock. The vein set 4 isotopic values are best explained by\\nmixing the saline end-member at ∼ 100 ◦C with a δ13CVPDB\\nsource of ∼ −12 ‰ (Fig. 4b). This low δ13C value is consis-\\ntent with derivation from organic matter (Boles et al., 2004).\\nHydrocarbons are present regionally and in the strata that\\nhosts the Hurricane fault (Bahr, 1963; Blakey, 1979). Mo-\\nbilization and microbial oxidation of these hydrocarbons to\\nform dissolved carbonate (Baedecker et al., 1993; Tuccillo et\\nal., 1999) has been shown in other fault settings to form cal-\\ncite veins with low δ13C values (e.g., Eichhubl et al., 2009).\\nIn addition to ﬂuid mixing over a range of temperatures,\\nother processes that occur during vein formation can also re-\\nsult in a range of calcite O and C stable isotope values. For\\nexample, open-system (Rayleigh) CO2 degassing and calcite\\nprecipitation results in progressive fractionation of C and O\\nstable isotopes in the ﬂuid that result in correlations between\\nδ13C and δ18O values (Hendy, 1971). Kampman et al. (2012)\\nused a Rayleigh fractionation model, assuming isotopic equi-\\nlibrium, to describe C and O stable isotope values observed in\\nfault-controlled aragonite veins and travertine deposits in the\\nSalt Wash graben, Utah, USA. In this system, coupled CO2\\ndegassing and carbonate precipitation from a homogenous\\nCO2-charged ﬂuid source can explain the positive correlation\\nand range in δ13C and δ18O values. In combination with U–\\nTh geochronological constraints, these authors suggest that\\nthis system has been active periodically for > 100 kyr with a\\nconsistent paleoﬂuid source and isotopic composition.\\nWe test if the positively correlated C and O values ob-\\nserved for vein set 1 (slope= 1.6) and set 2 (slope= 0.9)\\n(Fig. 4a) can be explained by similar processes. Rayleigh\\nfractionation trends are included on Fig. 4b for calcite result-\\ning from CO2 degassing (CO2-DIC), coupled CO2 degassing\\nand calcite precipitation (CO2-DIC-CC), and calcite precipi-\\ntation from groundwater (DIC-CC). These are calculated for\\nboth the carbon and oxygen isotope system using a Rayleigh\\ndistillation approach similar to Kampman et al. (2012). For\\nexample, for the progressive formation of calcite from bi-\\ncarbonate, the carbon isotope ratios can be calculated from\\nEq. (4):\\n13C = δ\\n(4)\\nwhere δ13Co is the starting carbon isotope ratio for HCO−\\n3 in\\nsolution, and F is the fraction of the C remaining in solution.\\nTemperature-dependent equilibrium fractionation factors (α)\\nfor carbon isotopes in the calcite–CO2–dissolved inorganic\\ncarbon (DIC) system are derived from Deines et al. (1974).\\nWe assume that the paleoﬂuids were slightly acidic (∼ 6.5)\\nand near the equivalence point of H2CO3 and HCO−\\n3 to com-\\npute the αDIC–CO2 (Gilﬁllan et al., 2009). This is consistent\\nwith pH and geochemical observations at Pah Tempe hot\\n"

The expected\\ntypical outdoor average radon concentration is 10 Bq/m3 [11]. The overall values for the whole dataset\\nindicated radon levels above the world mean radon concentration in outdoor environments and\\nare also higher when compared to levels found in other studies [35,36]. The obtained radon levels\\nthat are higher than average could be enhanced by elevated uranium and associated radionuclides\\ncontained in tailings residues, whereas the wide variability observed could be explained by the\\ndiversity of mineralisation in source-terms. However, the results from linear regression analysis, as\\nshown in Figure 8, revealed a weak positive correlation (R2 = 0.1483), which also coincides with the\\nresults obtained from Spearman Correlation analysis (rs = 0.09440). The selection criteria for the\\npresented correlation coefficients were based on uranium and radon levels measured in the same\\nlocations. Furthermore, it is worth noting that there are few pairs of values of uranium and radon\\nunder this criterion.\\n   \n",

Based on whole-rock Ar-Ar dating,\\nXia et al. [15] proposed that the diabase dikes were emplaced at 49.5 +- 5 Ma. However, LA-ICP-MS\\nanalysis of zircons from mafic dike in Baixingtu ore deposit yielded an age of 70.0 +- 3.0 Ma [37].\\nTherefore, detailed geochronology and geochemistry of the mafic rocks could provide important\\ninformation for regional tectonic evolution of the basin.\\n   \n",

This interval completes the first fining-upward sequence.\\nA second, 30-cm upward fining succession begins with a bed of cross bedded vitric ash that passes\\nupward to rippled ash and to massive white argillaceous siltstone.

       "50933   the Bruneau Woodpile, all fossil wood is mineralized with carbonate-fluorapatite,\\nbut phosphate minerals are not detectable in the surrounding sandstone matrix. This mode of\\noccurrence is evidence that unique geochemical conditions were present within the buried plant tissue.\\nThe hyaloclastic lake sediment would have potentially provided an abundant source of dissolved\\nsilica: pumice and volcanic ash are commonly associated with silicified wood, and experimental\\nstudies have shown obsidian to be a good source of dissolved silica for wood mineralization [78].\\nThe presence of diatom fossils in the lakebed sediment is evidence that dissolved silica was available,\\nand mineralization of the wood with calcium phosphate rather than silica is probable evidence that\\nthat Eh/pH conditions within the buried tissue were not favorable for silica precipitation. This is\\nconsistent with experimental evidence [78] demonstrating that when obsidian powder is used as\\na silica source, dissolved Si levels were elevated at pH values > 9. For wood that contained absorbed\\nsilica, a decrease in pH caused breakdown of hydrogen bonds between silica complexes and organic\\nmolecules, releasing silica back into aqueous solution. These experiments suggest that the low pH\\nvalues typical of calcium phosphate precipitation would not have been favorable for silicification.\\nThe absence of phosphate minerals in the matrix that encloses the fossil wood is an indication that\\nphospatization involved local geochemical gradients rather than more general diagenetic conditions.\\nThe mode of phosphate mineralization is unclear. One possibility is that at the Bruneau Woodpile\\ncarbonate-fluorapatite was deposited via process of organic templating, where deposition of calcium\\nphosphate was facilitated by an affinity with cell wall constituents, analogous to the hydrogen\\nbonds that form between silica and hydroxyl functional groups on organic wood molecules [56,79].\\nThis organic templating possibility is consistent with SEM views of Bruneau wood, which show that\\ncell walls contain microcrystalline carbonate-fluorapatite that preserves anatomical details with many\\nvessel lumen remaining unmineralized (Figure 11).\\n   \n",

In Loiano, the combined effect of cataclasis and\\ncompaction in the DBs causes porosity reduction by 1 order\\nof magnitude, permeability reduction by 3 orders of magni-\\ntude, and advective velocity reduction by 2 orders of magni-\\ntude with respect to the host rock (Del Sole and Antonellini,\\n2019; Supplement S3). Similarly, DBs in the Bollene quarry\\nhave lower permeability (up to 3 orders of magnitude) and\\nporosity (up to 50 %) (Ballas et al., 2014; see also Supple-\\nment S3) when compared to the host rock. A lower perme-\\nability, a higher degree of tortuosity (i.e., lower pore size),\\nand reduced section area available for flow (i.e., lower poros-\\nity) in the DBs compared to the host rock may cause a flow\\n\"slowdown\". In Loiano, the slowdown effect would be more\\npronounced when considering the normal-to-DB flow than\\nthe parallel-to-DB one given that normal-to-DB permeabili-\\nties are lower (1 order of magnitude in average) when com-\\npared to parallel-to-DB ones (Del Sole et al., 2020).

The expected\\ntypical outdoor average radon concentration is 10 Bq/m3 [11]. The overall values for the whole dataset\\nindicated radon levels above the world mean radon concentration in outdoor environments and\\nare also higher when compared to levels found in other studies [35,36]. The obtained radon levels\\nthat are higher than average could be enhanced by elevated uranium and associated radionuclides\\ncontained in tailings residues, whereas the wide variability observed could be explained by the\\ndiversity of mineralisation in source-terms. However, the results from linear regression analysis, as\\nshown in Figure 8, revealed a weak positive correlation (R2  0.1483), which also coincides with the\\nresults obtained from Spearman Correlation analysis (rs  0.09440). The selection criteria for the\\npresented correlation coefficients were based on uranium and radon levels measured in the same\\nlocations. Furthermore, it is worth noting that there are few pairs of values of uranium and radon\\nunder this criterion.\\n  \n",

Based on whole-rock Ar-Ar dating,\\nXia et al. [15] proposed that the diabase dikes were emplaced at 49.5  5 Ma.

This interval completes the first fining-upward sequence.\\nA second, 30-cm upward fining succession begins with a bed of cross bedded vitric ash that passes\\nupward to rippled ash and to massive white argillaceous siltstone.

       "50933   the Bruneau Woodpile, all fossil wood is mineralized with carbonate-fluorapatite,\\nbut phosphate minerals are not detectable in the surrounding sandstone matrix. This mode of\\noccurrence is evidence that unique geochemical conditions were present within the buried plant tissue.\\nThe hyaloclastic lake sediment would have potentially provided an abundant source of dissolved\\nsilica: pumice and volcanic ash are commonly associated with silicified wood, and experimental\\nstudies have shown obsidian to be a good source of dissolved silica for wood mineralization [78].\\nThe presence of diatom fossils in the lakebed sediment is evidence that dissolved silica was available,\\nand mineralization of the wood with calcium phosphate rather than silica is probable evidence that\\nthat Eh/pH conditions within the buried tissue were not favorable for silica precipitation. This is\\nconsistent with experimental evidence [78] demonstrating that when obsidian powder is used as\\na silica source, dissolved Si levels were elevated at pH values  9. For wood that contained absorbed\\nsilica, a decrease in pH caused breakdown of hydrogen bonds between silica complexes and organic\\nmolecules, releasing silica back into aqueous solution. These experiments suggest that the low pH\\nvalues typical of calcium phosphate precipitation would not have been favorable for silicification.\\nThe absence of phosphate minerals in the matrix that encloses the fossil wood is an indication that\\nphospatization involved local geochemical gradients rather than more general diagenetic conditions.\\nThe mode of phosphate mineralization is unclear. One possibility is that at the Bruneau Woodpile\\ncarbonate-fluorapatite was deposited via process of organic templating, where deposition of calcium\\nphosphate was facilitated by an affinity with cell wall constituents, analogous to the hydrogen\\nbonds that form between silica and hydroxyl functional groups on organic wood molecules [56,79].\\nThis organic templating possibility is consistent with SEM views of Bruneau wood, which show that\\ncell walls contain microcrystalline carbonate-fluorapatite that preserves anatomical details with many\\nvessel lumen remaining unmineralized (Figure 11).\\n  \n",

In Loiano, the combined effect of cataclasis and\\ncompaction in the DBs causes porosity reduction by 1 order\\nof magnitude, permeability reduction by 3 orders of magni-\\ntude, and advective velocity reduction by 2 orders of magni-\\ntude with respect to the host rock (Del Sole and Antonellini,\\n2019; Supplement S3). Similarly, DBs in the Bollene quarry\\nhave lower permeability (up to 3 orders of magnitude) and\\nporosity (up to 50  (Ballas et al., 2014; see also Supple-\\nment S3) when compared to the host rock. A lower perme-\\nability, a higher degree of tortuosity (i.e., lower pore size),\\nand reduced section area available for flow (i.e., lower poros-\\nity) in the DBs compared to the host rock may cause a flow\\n\"slowdown\". In Loiano, the slowdown effect would be more\\npronounced when considering the normal-to-DB flow than\\nthe parallel-to-DB one given that normal-to-DB permeabili-\\nties are lower (1 order of magnitude in average) when com-\\npared to parallel-to-DB ones (Del Sole et al., 2020).

Magenta picks (PsPTopME, phase 3)\\nrepresent the base of the youngest sediment units. The ge-\\nometry of these sediment layers is well imaged in the multi-\\nchannel seismic data (Fig. 2) by a strong positive reflector\\n(PsPTopME). Red picks (PsME, phase 2) follow the first ar-\\nrivals to an offset of  15 km (3.5 to 4.5 s), representing re-\\nfracted waves travelling through the evaporite layers with an\\napparent velocity of 4.5 km s-1. At about 15 km offset from\\nthe station, at the limit of the red picks (phase 2), a prominent\\nshadow zone indicates a strong negative velocity inversion in\\nthe subsurface including a thick low-velocity zone. The near-\\noffset early arrivals are offset by 1.5 s to the deeper crustal\\nfirst-arrival phases (light green picks, Pg, phase 10) that have\\nbeen recorded starting at roughly 6 s. A strong negative re-\\nflector starting at zero offset is present on all OBS record\\nsections and is picked in dark blue (PsPBotME, phase 5). It\\nmarks the base of the Messinian unit at  3.6 s at zero off-\\nset. After a  1.4 s long sequence of high-amplitude reflec-\\ntors follows a low-frequency high-amplitude reflector (dark\\ngreen, PsPTopAU, phase 7) visible between 0 and 20 km off-\\nset at  5 s.

Given that separate process-\\ning of the Sallsjo profile showed generally subhorizontal re-\\nflections to be present below it, or reflections with NW dip\\n(Fig. 5), the Sallsjo data and part of the Liten-Damman data\\nwere projected onto a straight CDP processing line (Fig. 2).\\nLikewise, the southeasterly part of the Liten-Damman data\\nwere combined with the Damman-Hallen data and processed\\nalong a straight CDP line (Fig. 2). Inspection of Fig. 5 shows\\nthat this methodology is generally justified, even for the\\nhighly crooked Sallsjo profile. The general characteristics of\\nthe Liten-Damman profile (Fig. 5a) are maintained in the\\nmerged section (Fig. 5c), while the projection of the data\\nfrom the Sallsjo profile (Fig. 5b) fills in the gap due to the\\nacquisition constraints. Although the details in the merged\\nLiten-Damman and Sallsjo section may not be accurate, the\\ngeneral structure in the area is well represented.\\n   \n",

Stage I (or phase-in) corresponds to the\\nemplacement of the loading column, which refers to the\\nalignment of pistons and samples (and possibly edge ef-\\nfects of the loaded faces, due to small departures from paral-\\nlelism). Stage II represents the pseudo-elastic regime, which\\n   \n",

In addition,\\nour field investigations and micro-mammalian data by Jost\\net al. (2016) revealed that the Muschelsandstein follows on\\ntop of the OMM-Ia and most likely corresponds in age\\nto the OMM-Ib. Based on these arguments, we constrain\\nthe deposition in the distal basin to the time interval be-\\ntween ca. 19 and 18 Ma (Fig. 5b). However, based on seis-\\nmostratigraphic investigations of line 8307, Schlunegger et\\nal. (1997a) proposed that sedimentation was interrupted at\\nca. 18 Ma by a ca. 0.5 Myr long or possibly longer hia-\\ntus. This time span was later specified through new micro-\\nmammalian discoveries by Jost et al. (2016), who noted that\\na record of MN4a is missing in the Wohlen area and that\\nthe base of the OMM-II hosts mammalian fragments that\\ncorrespond to MN4b. The interpretation of an inferred un-\\nconformity is additionally supported through observations of\\nvadose cements (Allen et al., 1985) within the Muschelsand-\\nstein and through evidence of a thick palaeosol separating\\nOMM-I from OMM-II in the Entlen section (see Sects. 4\\nand 5). We use the occurrence of vadose cements and the\\npalaeosol to propose that the uppermost beds of the OMM-\\nIb (including the Muschelsandstein) were exposed to erosion,\\nor non-sedimentation, after deposition. Furthermore, because\\nthe Muschelsandstein unit records the deepest water depth\\n   \n",

The geometry of these sediment layers is well imaged in the multichannel seismic data (Fig. 2) by a strong positive reflector\\n(PsPTopME). Red picks (PsME, phase 2) follow the first arrivals to an offset of  15 km (3.5 to 4.5 s), representing refracted waves travelling through the evaporite layers with an\\napparent velocity of 4.5 km s-1. At about 15 km offset from\\nthe station, at the limit of the red picks (phase 2), a prominent\\nshadow zone indicates a strong negative velocity inversion in\\nthe subsurface including a thick low-velocity zone. The nearoffset early arrivals are offset by 1.5 s to the deeper crustal\\nfirst-arrival phases (light green picks, Pg, phase 10) that have\\nbeen recorded starting at roughly 6 s. A strong negative reflector starting at zero offset is present on all OBS record\\nsections and is picked in dark blue (PsPBotME, phase 5). It\\nmarks the base of the Messinian unit at  3.6 s at zero offset. After a  1.4 s long sequence of high-amplitude reflectors follows a low-frequency high-amplitude reflector (dark\\ngreen, PsPTopAU, phase 7) visible between 0 and 20 km offset at  5 s.

       "112906  Correlations of the OMM deposits from the Entlen section\\nwith the Wohlen area were accomplished by Schlunegger\\net al. (1997a) through a seismostratigraphic analysis of the\\nseismic line 8307 (please see Fig. 2a for a trace of the\\nline). The seismic data show that the OMM-I deposits onlap\\nUSM strata and then overlap this unit (Fig. 5b). Schlunegger et al. (1997a) correlated the OMM-I sequence with their\\nUnit B in the Entlen section, which corresponds to the top\\nof the OMM-Ia in our stratigraphic scheme. In addition,\\nour field investigations and micro-mammalian data by Jost\\net al.

Based on these arguments, we constrain\\nthe deposition in the distal basin to the time interval between ca. 19 and 18 Ma (Fig. 5b).

(1997a) proposed that sedimentation was interrupted at\\nca. 18 Ma by a ca. 0.5 Myr long or possibly longer hiatus. This time span was later specified through new micromammalian discoveries by Jost et al. (2016), who noted that\\na record of MN4a is missing in the Wohlen area and that\\nthe base of the OMM-II hosts mammalian fragments that\\ncorrespond to MN4b. The interpretation of an inferred unconformity is additionally supported through observations of\\nvadose cements (Allen et al., 1985) within the Muschelsandstein and through evidence of a thick palaeosol separating\\nOMM-I from OMM-II in the Entlen section (see Sects. 4\\nand 5). We use the occurrence of vadose cements and the\\npalaeosol to propose that the uppermost beds of the OMM-\\nIb (including the Muschelsandstein) were exposed to erosion,\\nor non-sedimentation, after deposition. Furthermore, because\\nthe Muschelsandstein unit records the deepest water depth\\n  "

       "91130   C higher than present in the West Kunlun Mountains\\nduring 40-30 ka BP [12]. The dD and d18O in water inclusions of salt rock from wellbores of the\\nCharhan Salt Lake in the Qaidam Basin on the northeastern QTP also indicate a climate of 2\\nC warmer\\nthan at present [103]. The climate on the western QTP was relatively cool and moist, with annual\\nprecipitation of about 400 mm and extensive expansion of lakes; hence, this time was also dubbed\\nas the Great Lakes period [65]. Evident lowering of carbonate content was discovered at depths of\\n6.0-5.5 m (equivalent of 35-33 ka BP) in lacustrine sediments in the Tianshui'hai Lake in the western\\nKunlun Mountains; at the same depths, the assemblage of Dolerocypris fasciata Muller and Leucocythere\\nmirabilis Kaufmann indicated a warm, freshwater lake environment [104,105]. Thus, the period from\\n50-26 ka BP had to be caused by a warm Interstadial, which is supported by rich evidence (e.g., [106]),\\npermafrost did not survive through the LG Interstadial in most parts of the western QTP. However,\\nwe should be careful in judging the degrading permafrost from retreat glaciers, because glaciers or\\npermafrost, such as those in the Canadian Rockies are retreating primarily due to reduced precipitation,\\nas well as rising temperatures [107-109].\\n   \n",

The initial pH value of the mixed solution\\nis approximately 11.5. White precipitates were obtained after mixing the solutions in the reaction\\nvessel. The precipitates were immediately filtered using a membrane filter (0.45 um) with vacuum\\nfiltration. Obtained precipitates were then washed with acetone and dried at 25\\nC for 1 day in a\\nvacuum desiccator evacuated with a diaphragm pump. The reasons why the sample solutions were\\nkept at 0\\nC and the obtained ACC samples were rinsed with acetone are to avoid crystallization of\\ncalcite. Synthesized Sr-doped ACC samples were pressurized using a hydraulic press in a tungsten\\ncarbide (WC) piston-cylinder of 4 mm inner diameter at 0.8 GPa for 10 min at room temperature for\\npressure-induced crystallization of calcite. After decompression, the samples were recovered and kept\\nin a vacuum desiccator to remove water that emitted after pressure-induced crystallization.

       "84767   Abstract: Beach ridges constructed by pluvial Lake Clover in Elko County, Nevada during the Late\\nPleistocene were investigated with ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The primary objective was to\\ndocument the internal architecture of these shorelines and to evaluate whether they were constructed\\nduring lake rise or fall. GPR data were collected with a ground-coupled 400-Mhz antenna and\\nSIR-3000 controller. To constrain the morphology of the ridges, detailed topographic surveys were\\ncollected with a Topcon GTS-235W total station referenced to a second class 0 vertical survey point.\\nGPR transects crossed the beach ridge built by Lake Clover at its highstand of 1725 m, along with\\nseven other ridges down to the lowest beach at 1712 m. An average dielectric permittivity of 5.0,\\ntypical for dry sand and gravel, was calculated from GPR surveys in the vicinity of hand-excavations\\nthat encountered prominent stratigraphic discontinuities at known depths. Assuming this value,\\nconsistent radar signals were returned to a depth of ~3 m. Beach ridges are resolvable as ~90 to\\n150-cm thick stratified packages of gravelly sand overlying a prominent lakeward-dipping reflector,\\ninterpreted as the pre-lake land surface. Many ridges contain a package of sediment resembling a\\nburied berm at their core, typically offset in a landward direction from the geomorphic crest of the\\nbeach ridge. Sequences of lakeward-dipping reflectors are resolvable beneath the beach face of all\\nridges. No evidence was observed to indicate that beach ridges were submerged by higher water\\nlevels after their formation. Instead, the GPR data are consistent with a model of sequential ridge\\nformation during a monotonic lake regression.\\n   \n",

Later, during\\nthe Cretaceous, deep realms were widespread both in Prebetic and Subbetic domains. The Cenozoic\\nshows a greater variety of sediments, which are marked by detritic supplies alternating with deep or\\nshallow-water deposits [16,29,40]. Many Neogene deformation phases were proposed [33]: thrusting\\n(Early Miocene), normal faulting (Middle Miocene) and development of strike-slip faulting (Late\\nMiocene). Furthermore, studies concerning the Eocene platform areas were carried out by Geel [12,13]\\nand Geel et al. [14]. Also, analyses on deeper marine sediments were developed by Roep and Everts [11].\\nMore recently, specific papers concerning the tectono-sedimentary evolution of Cenozoic basins\\nin the eastern EBZ have been published. Guerrera et al. [15] and Guerrera and Martin-Martin [18]\\npropose the Paleogene evolution of the Cenozoic Alicante Trough Basin characterized by a narrow\\nshaped sedimentary basin with tectonically active margins located to the NNW in the Jijona-Elda area\\n   \n",

The initial pH value of the mixed solution\\nis approximately 11.5. White precipitates were obtained after mixing the solutions in the reaction\\nvessel. The precipitates were immediately filtered using a membrane filter (0.45 um) with vacuum\\nfiltration. Obtained precipitates were then washed with acetone and dried at 25\\nC for 1 day in a\\nvacuum desiccator evacuated with a diaphragm pump. The reasons why the sample solutions were\\nkept at 0\\nC and the obtained ACC samples were rinsed with acetone are to avoid crystallization of\\ncalcite. Synthesized Sr-doped ACC samples were pressurized using a hydraulic press in a tungsten\\ncarbide (WC) piston-cylinder of 4 mm inner diameter at 0.8 GPa for 10 min at room temperature for\\npressure-induced crystallization of calcite. After decompression, the samples were recovered and kept\\nin a vacuum desiccator to remove water that emitted after pressure-induced crystallization.

       "84767   Abstract: Beach ridges constructed by pluvial Lake Clover in Elko County, Nevada during the Late\\nPleistocene were investigated with ground-penetrating radar (GPR. The primary objective was to\\ndocument the internal architecture of these shorelines and to evaluate whether they were constructed\\nduring lake rise or fall. GPR data were collected with a ground-coupled 400-Mhz antenna and\\nSIR-3000 controller. To constrain the morphology of the ridges, detailed topographic surveys were\\ncollected with a Topcon GTS-235W total station referenced to a second class 0 vertical survey point.\\nGPR transects crossed the beach ridge built by Lake Clover at its highstand of 1725 m, along with\\nseven other ridges down to the lowest beach at 1712 m. An average dielectric permittivity of 5.0,\\ntypical for dry sand and gravel, was calculated from GPR surveys in the vicinity of hand-excavations\\nthat encountered prominent stratigraphic discontinuities at known depths. Assuming this value,\\nconsistent radar signals were returned to a depth of ~3 m. Beach ridges are resolvable as ~90 to\\n150-cm thick stratified packages of gravelly sand overlying a prominent lakeward-dipping reflector,\\ninterpreted as the pre-lake land surface. Many ridges contain a package of sediment resembling a\\nburied berm at their core, typically offset in a landward direction from the geomorphic crest of the\\nbeach ridge. Sequences of lakeward-dipping reflectors are resolvable beneath the beach face of all\\nridges. No evidence was observed to indicate that beach ridges were submerged by higher water\\nlevels after their formation. Instead, the GPR data are consistent with a model of sequential ridge\\nformation during a monotonic lake regression.\\n  \n",

Later, during\\nthe Cretaceous, deep realms were widespread both in Prebetic and Subbetic domains. The Cenozoic\\nshows a greater variety of sediments, which are marked by detritic supplies alternating with deep or\\nshallow-water deposits [16,29,40]. Many Neogene deformation phases were proposed [33]: thrusting\\n(Early Miocene, normal faulting (Middle Miocene) and development of strike-slip faulting (Late\\nMiocene. Furthermore, studies concerning the Eocene platform areas were carried out by Geel [12,13]\\nand Geel et al. [14]. Also, analyses on deeper marine sediments were developed by Roep and Everts [11].\\nMore recently, specific papers concerning the tectono-sedimentary evolution of Cenozoic basins\\nin the eastern EBZ have been published. Guerrera et al. [15] and Guerrera and Martin-Martin [18]\\npropose the Paleogene evolution of the Cenozoic Alicante Trough Basin characterized by a narrow\\nshaped sedimentary basin with tectonically active margins located to the NNW in the Jijona-Elda area\\n  \n",

Our study shows that the Mg isotope fractionation between biotite and garnet is significant, in the range of 0.92 1.48 %0 \\n(Fig. 2). Different mineral fragments from the same metapelite yield identical \\nMg isotopic compositions (Table S-1), suggesting negligible intra-mineral Mg \\nisotopic variations and thus implying the equilibrium Mg isotope fractionation. \\nThe degree of equilibrium isotope fractionation is a function of temperature, \\n   \n",

The wetland has two shallow basins, one to the north and one in the south. The wetland\\nis today a bog, but had open water during the early Holocene. The wetland, and to some extent the\\nwestern slope of the ridge, displays a chrono-stratigraphical sequence of layers from the Mesolithic,\\ni.e., the period ca. 9500-4000 cal BC.

       "92939   Two studies of speleothem records at Pinnacle Point on the south coast of South Africa,\\nshow considerably larger variability of d18O than at Cango Cave albeit during different time intervals.\\nThis is likely due to the difference in sampling resolution between these records. A first record from\\nCrevice Cave covering the interval between 90 and 53 ka [30] was extended by adding speleothem\\nsamples from PP29 (112-43 ka) and Staircase Cave (330-130 ka) [59]. The caves at Pinnacle Point\\nare not classical karst caves hosted in dolomite or limestone, but instead formed in crevices in the\\nlocal Cape Supergroup sandstones. However, a combination of repetition tests and Hendy tests at\\nthe three caves supports environmental factors as being the main drivers of isotopic change [30,59].\\nVariations of d13C were interpreted as reflecting changes of vegetation above the caves. Monitoring of\\nrainwater d18O in the nearby town of Mossel Bay has shown considerable seasonal variations [30,116].\\nChanges of the d18O values of speleothems therefore have been interpreted in terms of variations in\\nthe seasonality of rainfall and associated synoptic conditions [30,59]. Higher summer rainfall and\\nincreased abundance of C4 plants are usually associated with higher summer insolation in the southern\\nhemisphere during phases of increased precession parameter. Winter rainfall and C3 vegetation are\\nmore common in phases with low precession parameters or during interglacial phases when the\\nwesterlies are shifted south.\\n   \n",

       "92939   Two studies of speleothem records at Pinnacle Point on the south coast of South Africa,\\nshow considerably larger variability of d18O than at Cango Cave albeit during different time intervals.\\nThis is likely due to the difference in sampling resolution between these records. A first record from\\nCrevice Cave covering the interval between 90 and 53 ka 30 was extended by adding speleothem\\nsamples from PP29 112-43 ka and Staircase Cave 330-130 ka 59. The caves at Pinnacle Point\\nare not classical karst caves hosted in dolomite or limestone, but instead formed in crevices in the\\nlocal Cape Supergroup sandstones. However, a combination of repetition tests and Hendy tests at\\nthe three caves supports environmental factors as being the main drivers of isotopic change 30,59.\\nVariations of d13C were interpreted as reflecting changes of vegetation above the caves. Monitoring of\\nrainwater d18O in the nearby town of Mossel Bay has shown considerable seasonal variations 30,116.\\nChanges of the d18O values of speleothems therefore have been interpreted in terms of variations in\\nthe seasonality of rainfall and associated synoptic conditions 30,59. Higher summer rainfall and\\nincreased abundance of C4 plants are usually associated with higher summer insolation in the southern\\nhemisphere during phases of increased precession parameter. Winter rainfall and C3 vegetation are\\nmore common in phases with low precession parameters or during interglacial phases when the\\nwesterlies are shifted south.\\n  \n",

       "97373  The climate seems to be an important driver of changes in Lake Lehmilampi during the last 200 years despite human influence, because the recent diatom assemblage change is likely related to a warming climate, and several statistically significant correlations were found between climate variables and hypoxia volume Table 4. These correlations reflect relationships between yearly, seasonal, and monthly variations and do not take into account single extreme events or possible time lags between climate forcing and responses in hypolimnetic hypoxia. Nevertheless, increased hypoxia volumes seem to coincide at least with milder winters and drier Octobers Table 4. Climate controls the alternating stratification and overturn periods in boreal lakes 86, which also affect oxygen availability. Therefore, it is not unexpected to find correlations between climate variables and hypoxia volumes. Dry Octobers could reduce the intensity of autumn overturn via diminished runoff of oxygen-rich water into the lake. However, the positive correlation between hypoxia volume and winter temperature is interesting and unexpected, because cold winters typically extend ice cover, which weakens circulation in the lake through thermal stratification and reduces oxygen availability in bottom waters 16. The mechanisms beyond these correlations cannot be explained using our data and remain as topics for further investigations.   \n",

Each band was incubated overnight in 20 mL of ultra clean water at 4 degC. The DGGE bands were reamplified using 2 mL on extracted DNA as template using the same PCR conditions and primers as for the original PCR, except without the GC-clamp. The reamplified DGGE bands were sent for purification and sequencing to Macrogen Inc., Seoul, Korea. The 16S rRNA fragments were sequenced with the U1401r primer and the dsrB gene fragments with primer dsr4R.   \n",

While the native camelids might not be as profitable as sheep and cattle, they fair better during droughts and frosts and require less supervision. The environmental impact of cattle and sheep is also considerably higher than llamas and alpacas because the former uproot and trample vegetation and consume more pasture than camelids 91. It is quite possible that the intensification of livestock raising produced overgrazing and soil erosion, facilitating the establishment of exotic weeds, including Trifolium 95,101. In recent times, the Cosapilla peatland has experienced a mild retraction with an associated expansion of grasslands and shrubs. The appearance of Plantago and an abrupt increase of Trifolium could suggest a decrease of traditional management and a degradation of the peatland, favoring the establishment of species resistant to trampling and increased herd browsing pressure. Currently, some highland Andean wetlands located near the study area show clear signs of degradation due to climate change and loss of human traditional management practices, which are inducing the reorganization of plant communities.

       "95775   The evidence of European conquest on the Andes is also present in the pollen record. After the Spanish conquest, peatland pollen continues to be abundant and probably represents the continual effort of the local population to maintain the wetland for grazing of domestic camelids and introduced livestock. Pollen of the exotic clover Trifolium becomes abundant between 600 and 100 year BP, possibly in relation to the translocation of sheep and cattle herds 7,98. Currently, Andean pastoralists keep mixed herds of native and exotic animals as a way to diversify their economy 99,100. While the native camelids might not be as profitable as sheep and cattle, they fair better during droughts and frosts and require less supervision. The environmental impact of cattle and sheep is also considerably higher than llamas and alpacas because the former uproot and trample vegetation and consume more pasture than camelids 91. It is quite possible that the intensification of livestock raising produced overgrazing and soil erosion, facilitating the establishment of exotic weeds, including Trifolium 95,101. In recent times, the Cosapilla peatland has experienced a mild retraction with an associated expansion of grasslands and shrubs. The appearance of Plantago and an abrupt increase of Trifolium could suggest a decrease of traditional management and a degradation of the peatland, favoring the establishment of species resistant to trampling and increased herd browsing pressure. Currently, some highland Andean wetlands located near the study area show clear signs of degradation due to climate change and loss of human traditional management practices, which are inducing the reorganization of plant communities. The overall trend suggests that during the last 2000 years, changes in vegetation dynamics were affected by climatic events as much as anthropogenic disturbance 71,102.    \n",

The scale of this aggregation is highly dependent upon the appropriate scale of wildfire response. A method proposed to address this scaling question is the development of PODs 43. Delineating features of these operational fire management polygons should ideally be tied to locations that could be used to slow or stop the spread of fire between PODs. Using this rationale, PODs developed for fire maintenance objectives would tend to be larger than those developed for restoration or protection objectives, corresponding to the likelihood of the need to suppress or modify fire behavior within each strategic response zone.    \n",

       "95775   The evidence of European conquest on the Andes is also present in the pollen record. After the Spanish conquest, peatland pollen continues to be abundant and probably represents the continual effort of the local population to maintain the wetland for grazing of domestic camelids and introduced livestock. Pollen of the exotic clover Trifolium becomes abundant between 600 and 100 year BP, possibly in relation to the translocation of sheep and cattle herds 7,98. Currently, Andean pastoralists keep mixed herds of native and exotic animals as away to diversify their economy 99,100. While the native camelids might not be as profitable as sheep and cattle, they fair better during droughts and frosts and require less supervision. The environmental impact of cattle and sheep is also considerably higher than llamas and alpacas because the former uproot and trample vegetation and consume more pasture than camelids 91. It is quite possible that the intensification of livestock raising produced overgrazing and soil erosion, facilitating the establishment of exotic weeds, including Trifolium 95,101. In recent times, the Cosapilla peatland has experienced a mild retraction with an associated expansion of grasslands and shrubs. The appearance of Plantago and an abrupt increase of Trifolium could suggest a decrease of traditional management and a degradation of the peatland, favoring the establishment of species resistant to trampling and increased herd browsing pressure. Currently, some highland Andean wetlands located near the study area show clear signs of degradation due to climate change and loss of human traditional management practices, which are inducing the reorganization of plant communities. The overall trend suggests that during the last 2000 years, changes in vegetation dynamics were affected by climatic events as much as anthropogenic disturbance 71,102.  \n",

The scale of this aggregation is highly dependent upon the appropriate scale of wildfire response. A method proposed to address this scaling question is the development of PODs 43. Delineating features of these operational fire management polygons should ideally be tied to locations that could be used to slow or stop the spread of fire between PODs. Using this rationale, PODs developed for fire maintenance objectives would tend to be larger than those developed for restoration or protection objectives, corresponding to the likelihood of the need to suppressor modify fire behavior within each strategic response zone.  \n",

We assess the addition of GLONASS (GLObal NAv-\\nigation Satellite System) to increase the accuracy and reli-\\nability of eight major ocean tide loading constituents: four\\nsemi-diurnal (M2, S2, N2, K2) and four diurnal constituents\\n(K1, O1, P1, Q1). We revisit a previous GPS study, focus-\\ning on 21 sites in the UK and western Europe, expanding\\nit with an assessment of GLONASS and GPS+GLONASS\\nestimates. In the region, both GPS and GLONASS data have\\nbeen abundant since 2010.0. We therefore focus on the period\\n2010.0-2014.0, a span considered long enough to reliably\\nestimate the major constituents. Data were processed with a\\nkinematic precise point positioning (PPP) strategy to produce\\nsite coordinate time series for each of three different modes:\\nGPS, GLONASS and GPS+GLONASS. The GPS solution\\nwith ambiguities resolved was used as a baseline for perfor-\\nmance assessment of the additional modes. GPS+GLONASS\\nshows very close agreement with ambiguity resolved GPS\\nfor lunar constituents (M2, N2, O1, Q1) but with substantial\\ndifferences for solar-related constituents (S2, K2, K1, P1),\\nwith solutions including GLONASS being generally closer\\nto model estimates. While no single constellation mode per-\\nforms best for all constituents and components, we propose\\nto use a combination of constellation modes to recover tidal\\nparameters: GPS+GLONASS for most constituents, except\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Abstract. The Hurricane fault is a ~ 250 km long, west-\\ndipping, segmented normal fault zone located along the\\ntransition between the Colorado Plateau and the Basin and\\nRange tectonic provinces in the western USA. Extensive ev-\\nidence of fault-fluid interaction includes calcite mineraliza-\\ntion and veining. Calcite vein carbon (d13CVPDB) and oxy-\\ngen (d18OVPDB) stable isotope ratios range from -4.5 %0\\nto 3.8 %0 and from -22.1 %0 to -1.1 %0, respectively. Fluid\\ninclusion microthermometry constrains paleofluid tempera-\\ntures and salinities from 45 to 160 *C and from 1.4 wt %\\nto 11.0 wt % as NaCl, respectively. These data suggest mix-\\ning between two primary fluid sources, including infiltrating\\nmeteoric water (70+- 10 *C, ~ 1.5 wt % NaCl, d18OVSMOW\\n~ -10 %0) and sedimentary brine (100+- 25 *C, ~ 11 wt %\\nNaCl, d18OVSMOW ~ 5 %0). Interpreted carbon sources in-\\nclude crustal- or magmatic-derived CO2, carbonate bedrock,\\nand hydrocarbons. Uranium-thorium (U-Th) dates from five\\ncalcite vein samples indicate punctuated fluid flow and frac-\\nture healing at 539+- 10.8 (1s ), 287.9+- 5.8, 86.2+- 1.7, and\\n86.0+- 0.2 ka in the upper 500 m of the crust. Collectively,\\ndata predominantly from the footwall damage zone imply\\nthat the Hurricane fault imparts a strong influence on the re-\\ngional flow of crustal fluids and that the formation of veins\\nin the shallow parts of the fault damage zone has important\\nimplications for the evolution of fault strength and perme-\\nability.\\n</td>\n",

Our results from the remote\\nboreal Lake Lehmilampi, however, suggest spatiotemporal fluctuations in varve preservation and\\nhypoxia instead of an increasing trend towards the present day (Figure 5a, Table 3). Oxygen-depleted\\nconditions have prevailed for thousands of years in the northern basin of Lake Lehmilampi based on\\nits continuous varve preservation [45]. The boundary between continuous and discontinuous varve\\npreservation (and hypoxia) is located relatively close to the maximum depths of the basins at water\\ndepths of 10.60-10.75 m, whereas the boundary between discontinuous and no varve preservation lies\\nat 6.53-7.20 m. The limited water quality data from Lake Lehmilampi (Figure 1c) suggests that hypoxia\\nmay temporarily reach even slightly shallower depths. Certain characteristics of Lake Lehmilampi,\\nsuch as the strong seasonal contrasts in boreal climate, elongated and small but relatively deep basins,\\nand higher-relief bedrock outcrops sheltering the lake from winds, are favorable for the formation and\\npreservation of varves [19].\\n\n",

Dose rates were determined from the sediment excavated around each tube using\\nhigh-resolution gamma spectrometry at Dartmouth College to measure the activity of 40K as well as\\ncertain isotopes in the 238U and 232Th decay chains. These activities were then converted to in situ\\ndose rates using standard conversion parameters [23] and the DRAC calculator v. 1.2 [24]. Because the\\ndose rate experienced by feldspar is partially derived from internal 40K, the potassium content of\\nthe K-feldspar was determined by EDS analysis of polished grains using a Vega Tescan3 SEM at\\nMiddlebury College.

       "100957  Shoreline reconstructions were made using the ArcGIS 10.3 software based on the shoreline\\ndisplacement records from Havang [6] and Blekinge [93]. Five palaeo-shoreline maps, showing the\\nshoreline configuration during five key periods, were created; the Yoldia Sea lowstand, the Ancylus\\nLake transgression phase, the Ancylus Lake maximum, the Initial Littorina Sea minimum and the\\nLittorina Sea transgression phase. The topographic data set was down-sampled to a spatial resolution of\\n10 m in order to make it compatible with the bathymetric data set before the two sets were merged into\\na seamless Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Due to the N-S difference in land uplift, and consequently\\ntilted past shorelines, the DEM needed to be tilted perpendicular to the isobases in order to produce\\naccurate past shorelines. The DEM tilt was performed by dividing the study area into segments in the\\nE-W direction, following the shape of the isobases of [59], where each segment represents a water level\\nchange of 0.1 m; 76 segments for the Yoldia Sea lowstand and the Ancylus Lake transgression phase,\\n121 segments for the Ancylus Lake maximum, 91 segments for the Initial Littorina Sea lowstand and 56\\nsegments for the Littorina Sea transgression phase. The segments cover the extent of the DEM and were\\nused to divide the DEM into corresponding segments, allowing each segment to be manipulated with\\na value 0.1 m relative to its neighboring segments in order to create a smooth tilt of the reconstructed\\nshorelines. A duplicate of each DEM segment was created and was given a different single elevation\\nvalue corresponding to the level of the shoreline displacement for each segment, interpolated between\\nthe Havang and Blekinge sites. The segment duplicate was then summed with its corresponding DEM\\nsegment (containing the present-day elevation data), which in effect moved the 0-value (shoreline) of\\n\n",

The\\npresent study has been formulated to determine the efficiency\\nof two plot sizes of 6 and 0.25 m2 covered by 0.5 kg m-2\\nof straw mulch with regard to changing the time to runoff,\\nrunoff coefficient, sediment concentration and soil loss un-\\nder laboratory conditions. The study used a sandy-loam soil\\ntaken from summer rangeland, Alborz Mountains, northern\\nIran, and was conducted under simulated rainfall intensities\\nof 50 and 90 mm h-1 and in three replicates. The results of\\nthe study showed that the straw mulch had a more significant\\neffect on reducing the runoff coefficient, sediment concentra-\\ntion and soil loss on a 0.25 m2 plot scale. The maximum ef-\\nfectiveness in time to runoff for both the scales was observed\\nat a rainfall intensity of 90 mm h-1. The maximum increas-\\ning and decreasing rates in time to runoff and runoff coef-\\nficient were observed at a rainfall intensity of 90 mm h-1,\\nwith 367.92 and 96.71 % for the 0.25 m2 plot and 110.10 and\\n15.08 % for the 6 m2 plot. The maximum reduction in the\\nrunoff coefficient was in the 0.25 m2 plot for the two rainfall\\nintensities of 50 and 90 mm h-1, with rates of -89.34 and\\n-96.71 %. The maximum change in soil loss at the intensi-\\nties of both 50 and 90 mm h-1 occurred in the 0.25 m2 plot,\\nwith 100 %, whereas in the 6 m2 plot, decreasing rates of soil\\nloss for the intensities of both 50 and 90 mm h-1 were 46.74\\nand 63.24 %, respectively.\\n\n",

The 0.25 m2 plot had the maximum re-\\nduction in runoff coefficient when rainfall intensities were 50\\nand 90 mm h-1. These results showed that the 0.25 m2 plot\\nhad the maximum impact on decreasing the runoff coefficient\\nand increasing time to runoff, except in the case of a rain-\\nfall intensity of 50 mm h-1. It verified that the straw mulch\\npieces could store more runoff, leading to more infiltration,\\nas already reported by Poesen and Lavee (1991), Choi et\\nal. (2012) and Liu et al. (2012). The results showed that there\\nwas large variation in the runoff coefficient (Smets et al.,\\n2008a) and time to runoff on the 0.25 m2 plots compared to\\nthose recorded for the 6 m2 plots at variousrainfallintensities.\\n\n",
       "106162                Abstract. Ground displacements due to ocean tide loading\\nhave previously been successfully observed using Global Po-\\nsitioning System (GPS) data, and such estimates for the prin-\\ncipal lunar M2 constituent have been used to infer the rhe-\\nology and structure of the asthenosphere. The GPS orbital\\nrepeat period is close to that of several other major tidal con-\\nstituents (K1, K2, S2); thus, GPS estimates of ground dis-\\nplacement at these frequencies are subject to GPS systematic\\nerrors. We assess the addition of GLONASS (GLObal NAv-\\nigation Satellite System) to increase the accuracy and reli-\\nability of eight major ocean tide loading constituents: four\\nsemi-diurnal (M2, S2, N2, K2) and four diurnal constituents\\n(K1, O1, P1, Q1). We revisit a previous GPS study, focus-\\ning on 21 sites in the UK and western Europe, expanding\\nit with an assessment of GLONASS and GPS+GLONASS\\nestimates. In the region, both GPS and GLONASS data have\\nbeen abundant since 2010.0. We therefore focus on the period\\n2010.0-2014.0, a span considered long enough to reliably\\nestimate the major constituents. Data were processed with a\\nkinematic precise point positioning (PPP) strategy to produce\\nsite coordinate time series for each of three different modes:\\nGPS, GLONASS and GPS+GLONASS. The GPS solution\\nwith ambiguities resolved was used as a baseline for perfor-\\nmance assessment of the additional modes.

All 45 sam-\\nples were collected from the lower part of the outcropping\\nsuccession.

Sampled limestones mostly con-\\nsist of peritidal, mud-supported, biopeloidal mudstones\\nand wackestones showing a benthic microfossiliferous as-\\nsemblage (mostly benthic foraminifers and ostracodes).\\nThe NRM intensity in those samples is relatively low\\n(0.08-6 mA m-1), and only 18 samples yielded inter-\\npretable demagnetization diagrams (Fig. 4). The mean\\ndirection of\\nthe isolated ChRMs in tilt-corrected co-\\nordinates is D+- D = 8.8+- 10.7*, I +- I = 46.6+- 11.4*\\n(N = 17, K = 15.2, A95= 9.4*) (Table 1 and Fig. 5). Be-\\nfore tilt correction, this direction is not statistically differ-\\nent from the present-day field (D +- D = 359.8+- 12.6*,\\nI +- I = 52.2+- 11.2*, N = 17, K = 12.4, A95= 10.5*)\\nand is probably the effect of a recent overprint. Accordingly,\\nthis site is not considered for further analyses.\\n\n",

The Hurricane fault is a ~ 250 km long, west-\\ndipping, segmented normal fault zone located along the\\ntransition between the Colorado Plateau and the Basin and\\nRange tectonic provinces in the western USA. Extensive ev-\\nidence of fault-fluid interaction includes calcite mineraliza-\\ntion and veining. Calcite vein carbon (d13CVPDB) and oxy-\\ngen (d18OVPDB) stable isotope ratios range from -4.5 %0\\nto 3.8 %0 and from -22.1 %0 to -1.1 %0, respectively. Fluid\\ninclusion microthermometry constrains paleofluid tempera-\\ntures and salinities from 45 to 160 *C and from 1.4 wt %\\nto 11.0 wt % as NaCl, respectively. These data suggest mix-\\ning between two primary fluid sources, including infiltrating\\nmeteoric water (70+- 10 *C, ~ 1.5 wt % NaCl, d18OVSMOW\\n~ -10 %0) and sedimentary brine (100+- 25 *C, ~ 11 wt %\\nNaCl, d18OVSMOW ~ 5 %0). Interpreted carbon sources in-\\nclude crustal- or magmatic-derived CO2, carbonate bedrock,\\nand hydrocarbons. Uranium-thorium (U-Th) dates from five\\ncalcite vein samples indicate punctuated fluid flow and frac-\\nture healing at 539+- 10.8 (1s ), 287.9+- 5.8, 86.2+- 1.7, and\\n86.0+- 0.2 ka in the upper 500 m of the crust. Collectively,\\ndata predominantly from the footwall damage zone imply\\nthat the Hurricane fault imparts a strong influence on the re-\\ngional flow of crustal fluids and that the formation of veins\\nin the shallow parts of the fault damage zone has important\\nimplications for the evolution of fault strength and perme-\\nability.\\n\n",

       "      <td>Abstract. The Hurricane fault is a ~ 250 km long, west-\\ndipping, segmented normal fault zone located along the\\ntransition between the Colorado Plateau and the Basin and\\nRange tectonic provinces in the western USA. Extensive ev-\\nidence of fault-fluid interaction includes calcite mineraliza-\\ntion and veining. Calcite vein carbon (d13CVPDB) and oxy-\\ngen (d18OVPDB) stable isotope ratios range from -4.5 %0\\nto 3.8 %0 and from -22.1 %0 to -1.1 %0, respectively. Fluid\\ninclusion microthermometry constrains paleofluid tempera-\\ntures and salinities from 45 to 160 *C and from 1.4 wt %\\nto 11.0 wt % as NaCl, respectively. These data suggest mix-\\ning between two primary fluid sources, including infiltrating\\nmeteoric water (70+- 10 *C, ~ 1.5 wt % NaCl, d18OVSMOW\\n~ -10 %0) and sedimentary brine (100+- 25 *C, ~ 11 wt %\\nNaCl, d18OVSMOW ~ 5 %0). Interpreted carbon sources in-\\nclude crustal- or magmatic-derived CO2, carbonate bedrock,\\nand hydrocarbons. Uranium-thorium (U-Th) dates from five\\ncalcite vein samples indicate punctuated fluid flow and frac-\\nture healing at 539+- 10.8 (1s ), 287.9+- 5.8, 86.2+- 1.7, and\\n86.0+- 0.2 ka in the upper 500 m of the crust. Collectively,\\ndata predominantly from the footwall damage zone imply\\nthat the Hurricane fault imparts a strong influence on the re-\\ngional flow of crustal fluids and that the formation of veins\\nin the shallow parts of the fault damage zone has important\\nimplications for the evolution of fault strength and perme-\\nability.\\n</td>\n",

       "119694  Abstract. The Hurricane fault is a ~ 250 km long, west-\\ndipping, segmented normal fault zone located along the\\ntransition between the Colorado Plateau and the Basin and\\nRange tectonic provinces in the western USA. Extensive ev-\\nidence of fault-fluid interaction includes calcite mineraliza-\\ntion and veining. Calcite vein carbon (d13CVPDB) and oxy-\\ngen (d18OVPDB) stable isotope ratios range from -4.5 %0\\nto 3.8 %0 and from -22.1 %0 to -1.1 %0, respectively. Fluid\\ninclusion microthermometry constrains paleofluid tempera-\\ntures and salinities from 45 to 160 *C and from 1.4 wt %\\nto 11.0 wt % as NaCl, respectively. These data suggest mix-\\ning between two primary fluid sources, including infiltrating\\nmeteoric water (70+- 10 *C, ~ 1.5 wt % NaCl, d18OVSMOW\\n~ -10 %0) and sedimentary brine (100+- 25 *C, ~ 11 wt %\\nNaCl, d18OVSMOW ~ 5 %0). Interpreted carbon sources in-\\nclude crustal- or magmatic-derived CO2, carbonate bedrock,\\nand hydrocarbons. Uranium-thorium (U-Th) dates from five\\ncalcite vein samples indicate punctuated fluid flow and frac-\\nture healing at 539+- 10.8 (1s ), 287.9+- 5.8, 86.2+- 1.7, and\\n86.0+- 0.2 ka in the upper 500 m of the crust. Collectively,\\ndata predominantly from the footwall damage zone imply\\nthat the Hurricane fault imparts a strong influence on the re-\\ngional flow of crustal fluids and that the formation of veins\\nin the shallow parts of the fault damage zone has important\\nimplications for the evolution of fault strength and perme-\\nability.\\n\n",

       "      <td>Abstract. The Hurricane fault is a ~ 250 km long, west-\\ndipping, segmented normal fault zone located along the\\ntransition between the Colorado Plateau and the Basin and\\nRange tectonic provinces in the western USA. Extensive ev-\\nidence of fault-fluid interaction includes calcite mineraliza-\\ntion and veining. Calcite vein carbon (d13CVPDB) and oxy-\\ngen (d18OVPDB) stable isotope ratios range from -4.5 %0\\nto 3.8 %0 and from -22.1 %0 to -1.1 %0, respectively. Fluid\\ninclusion microthermometry constrains paleofluid tempera-\\ntures and salinities from 45 to 160 *C and from 1.4 wt %\\nto 11.0 wt % as NaCl, respectively. These data suggest mix-\\ning between two primary fluid sources, including infiltrating\\nmeteoric water (70+- 10 *C, ~ 1.5 wt % NaCl, d18OVSMOW\\n~ -10 %0) and sedimentary brine (100+- 25 *C, ~ 11 wt %\\nNaCl, d18OVSMOW ~ 5 %0). Interpreted carbon sources in-\\nclude crustal- or magmatic-derived CO2, carbonate bedrock,\\nand hydrocarbons. Uranium-thorium (U-Th) dates from five\\ncalcite vein samples indicate punctuated fluid flow and frac-\\nture healing at 539+- 10.8 (1s ), 287.9+- 5.8, 86.2+- 1.7, and\\n86.0+- 0.2 ka in the upper 500 m of the crust. Collectively,\\ndata predominantly from the footwall damage zone imply\\nthat the Hurricane fault imparts a strong influence on the re-\\ngional flow of crustal fluids and that the formation of veins\\nin the shallow parts of the fault damage zone has important\\nimplications for the evolution of fault strength and perme-\\nability.\\n</td>\n",

       "119694  Abstract. The Hurricane fault is a ~ 250 km long, west-\\ndipping, segmented normal fault zone located along the\\ntransition between the Colorado Plateau and the Basin and\\nRange tectonic provinces in the western USA. Extensive ev-\\nidence of fault-fluid interaction includes calcite mineraliza-\\ntion and veining. Calcite vein carbon (d13CVPDB) and oxy-\\ngen (d18OVPDB) stable isotope ratios range from -4.5 %0\\nto 3.8 %0 and from -22.1 %0 to -1.1 %0, respectively. Fluid\\ninclusion microthermometry constrains paleofluid tempera-\\ntures and salinities from 45 to 160 *C and from 1.4 wt %\\nto 11.0 wt % as NaCl, respectively. These data suggest mix-\\ning between two primary fluid sources, including infiltrating\\nmeteoric water (70+- 10 *C, ~ 1.5 wt % NaCl, d18OVSMOW\\n~ -10 %0) and sedimentary brine (100+- 25 *C, ~ 11 wt %\\nNaCl, d18OVSMOW ~ 5 %0). Interpreted carbon sources in-\\nclude crustal- or magmatic-derived CO2, carbonate bedrock,\\nand hydrocarbons. Uranium-thorium (U-Th) dates from five\\ncalcite vein samples indicate punctuated fluid flow and frac-\\nture healing at 539+- 10.8 (1s ), 287.9+- 5.8, 86.2+- 1.7, and\\n86.0+- 0.2 ka in the upper 500 m of the crust. Collectively,\\ndata predominantly from the footwall damage zone imply\\nthat the Hurricane fault imparts a strong influence on the re-\\ngional flow of crustal fluids and that the formation of veins\\nin the shallow parts of the fault damage zone has important\\nimplications for the evolution of fault strength and perme-\\nability.\\n\n",

Moreover, as the numerical model magnitude\\nis of the order of the DInSAR uncertainty, it is not possi-\\nble to differentiate coseismic deformation from other type of\\nsubsidence.\\n\n",

Therefore, we cannot connect individual isotopic values\\nto individual fluid inclusions. Rather, we use the mean and\\nstandard deviation of measured temperatures in each sample along with the calcite d18OVSMOW value to estimate a\\nrange of paleofluid compositions (Table 1). Similarly, we associate this range of oxygen isotope values with the mean\\nand standard deviation of the paleofluid salinity as estimated\\nfrom fluid inclusion melting temperatures. The paleofluid\\nd18OVSMOW value and salinity (wt % as NaCl) estimates for\\nthese samples show a strong positive correlation (R2 = 0.8;\\nFig. 7). We interpret this correlation as mixing between two\\nend-member fluid types as well as the fact that, over the\\nhistory of fault-fluid interaction represented by these calcite veins, different proportions of ~ 100+- 25 *C, saline (~\\n11 wt % NaCl), high-d18OVSMOW (~ 5 %0) fluids have mixed\\nwith 70+- 10 *C lower-salinity (~ 1.5 wt % NaCl), lowerd18OVSMOW (~ -10 %0) ground waters.\\nWe suggest that the end-member characterized by high\\nd18O values and high salinity is consistent with sedimentary formation water (brine) that originated from extensive meteoric water-rock interaction and oxygen isotope\\nexchange with marine sedimentary sequences (e.g., Clayton et al., 1966). Assuming a 25-30 *C geothermal gradient and the range of fluid inclusion temperatures, the circulation depths for these ground waters ranges from 2 to\\n6 km. This geothermal gradient is consistent with most observations from geothermal exploration wells in the region\\n(Sommer and Budding, 1994).

In addition to the binary mixing described in Sect. 5.1, precipitation of calcite\\nfrom fluids with a range of temperatures is occurring along\\nflow paths. A fairly wide range of temperatures is evident\\nfrom the fluid inclusion work on vein sets 1 and 3. For a\\ngiven water d18OVSMOW and d13C (of dissolved CO2), varying temperature in Eqs.

Therefore, we cannot connect individual isotopic values\\nto individual fluid inclusions. Rather, we use the mean and\\nstandard deviation of measured temperatures in each sample along with the calcite d[REPL] value to estimate a\\nrange of paleofluid compositions (Table 1). Similarly, we associate this range of oxygen isotope values with the mean\\nand standard deviation of the paleofluid salinity as estimated\\nfrom fluid inclusion melting temperatures. The paleofluid\\nd[REPL] value and salinity (wt % as NaCl) estimates for\\nthese samples show a strong positive correlation (R2 = 0.8;\\nFig. 7). We interpret this correlation as mixing between two\\nend-member fluid types as well as the fact that, over the\\nhistory of fault-fluid interaction represented by these calcite veins, different proportions of ~ 100+- 25 *C, saline (~\\n11 wt % NaCl), high-d[REPL] (~ 5 %0) fluids have mixed\\nwith 70+- 10 *C lower-salinity (~ 1.5 wt % NaCl), lowerd[REPL] (~ -10 %0) ground waters.\\nWe suggest that the end-member characterized by high\\nd18O values and high salinity is consistent with sedimentary formation water (brine) that originated from extensive meteoric water-rock interaction and oxygen isotope\\nexchange with marine sedimentary sequences (e.g., Clayton et al., 1966). Assuming a 25-30 *C geothermal gradient and the range of fluid inclusion temperatures, the circulation depths for these ground waters ranges from 2 to\\n6 km.

In addition to the binary mixing described in Sect. 5.1, precipitation of calcite\\nfrom fluids with a range of temperatures is occurring along\\nflow paths. A fairly wide range of temperatures is evident\\nfrom the fluid inclusion work on vein sets 1 and 3. For a\\ngiven water d[REPL] and d13C (of dissolved CO2), varying temperature in Eqs. (2) and (3) results in trends in calcite\\nd[REPL] and d13CVPDB with a slope of ~ 2.3 (Fig. 4b).\\nTo explore the impacts of both temperature change and mixing, the calcite forming from the saline (d[REPL] = 5 %0)\\nand meteoric water (d[REPL] = -10 %0) end-members,\\nboth with a d13CVPDB = -6 %0, are superimposed on the observed data (Fig. 4b, shaded region). The vein set 1 pattern\\nis fairly well matched by calcite forming over a the range\\nof T consistent with the fluid inclusion measurements (90-\\n45 *C) from the low-salinity meteoric water end-member\\n(d[REPL] = -10 %0; d13CVPDB = -6 %0).

The lower premolar series is relatively long: the premolar/molar index varies\\nbetween 64.7 and 72.5% (M = 67.8%, n = 9). The lower tooth series proportion is very close to those of\\nthe deer samples from Untermassfeld (M = 65.1%, n = 26) and Perrier-Etouaires (M = 68.1%, n = 9),\\nand relatively longer than in the sample of Eucladoceros from Seneze (M = 63.3%, n = 17) (Figure 6A).\\nP4 normally is primitive, non-molarized; its parastilid and paraconid are separated; metaconid is\\nrounded and somewhat extended posteriorly due to the extension of its posterior wing. In one case\\n(the specimen BUG-30108), the metaconid of P4 gets in touch with the entoconid, and it almost closes\\nthe valley between metaconid and entoconid (Figure 7).\\n   \n",

This method can create virtual sources and receivers\\nin the subsurface (Wapenaar et al., 2014; Slob et al., 2014).\\nIn order to achieve this, the method requires a reflection response recorded at the surface of the Earth and an estimation\\nof the first arrival of the signal from a location in the subsurface to the receiver locations in the measurement array.\\nThis first arrival can be estimated from a background velocity model, which requires no detailed information about\\nthe subsurface. Through the Marchenko method, the Green's\\nfunction with a virtual receiver in the subsurface can be retrieved. Using this method, many virtual receivers can be\\ncreated in the subsurface, which can be used to monitor the\\nwave field from the virtual receiver locations to the receiver\\narray. To obtain the signal between an induced signal from\\nthe subsurface and the virtual receiver locations, homogeneous Green's function retrieval can be employed; however,\\nas pointed out before, the classical retrieval scheme would\\ninclude artifacts due to the open surface of the recording.\\nThese artifacts can disturb the interpretation of the signal.\\nAn alternative retrieval scheme was developed by Wapenaar\\net al. (2016), who showed that if a focusing function is used\\nin combination with a Green's function, an open surface can\\nbe used for the retrieval instead of an enclosing one, without\\nthe artifacts of the classical method when applied to an open\\nsurface. A focusing function is a wave field that is designed\\nto focus at a location in the subsurface and can be retrieved\\nfrom reflection data using the Marchenko method (van der\\nNeut et al., 2015).

It is important to note, in addition, that the examples expounded upon in\\nthis paper are dominantly from intraplate regions, where the only viable mechanism for driving and\\nsustaining vertical crustal motions is the lower-crustal displacement described above, giving rise to\\n'regional' or 'epeirogenic' uplift rather than the increases in relief that can occur in plate-boundary\\nzones as a result of plate-tectonic processes or the effects of active faulting. The latter can of course\\nalso give rise to localized vertical crustal motions, often overprinted onto a regional (epeirogenic)\\npattern of movement (e.g., [31,77,79]). A discussion of mechanisms of tectonic/atectonic uplift is not\\nfundamental to this review paper, which is not the place to expand upon the various models.

       "85079   Abstract: We studied twelve late Holocene organic deposits in West-Frisia, The Netherlands. Pollen,\\nspores, non-pollen palynomorphs, mosses, other botanical macrofossils and insect remains were\\nrecorded for reconstructions of changing environmental conditions. Eastern West-Frisia was a\\ncultivated landscape during the Bronze Age, but it became a freshwater wetland in the Late Bronze\\nAge. In most of our sites, radiocarbon dates show that time transgressive inundation of soils preceded\\nthe climate shift at 850 cal BC for several centuries. We suggest that solar forcing of climate change may\\nhave delivered the final push to the inundation and depopulation of West-Frisia, which had already\\ncommenced several centuries before, due to sealevel rise. We did not find evidence for significant\\nBronze Age tree growth in West-Frisia before the inundations. Vegetation successions in the new\\nwetlands developed from shallow mineral-rich freshwater to rich-fen vegetation. Subsequently poor\\nfen vegetation with birch and pine developed, and the natural succession led to ombrotrophic raised\\nbog vegetation. Complete successions from shallow, mineral-rich lakes to raised bog lasted between\\n1000 and 1500 calendar years. We hypothesize that medieval drainage and reclamation became\\npossible only when the mires of West-Frisia had reached the raised bog stage. Reclamation of raised\\nbogs by medieval farmers (drainage, eutrophication, peat digging) caused compaction, oxidation and\\nloss of the upper part of the peat deposit. Seeds of salt-tolerant and salt-demanding plant species\\nindicate that the medieval sites were inundated during storm surges with brackish or salt water, which\\ntriggered the farmers to build artificial mounds and, later, dikes. Under mounds and dikes, peat\\ndeposits remained protected against further decay. With our data we deliver a long-term perspective\\non contemporary ecosystem dynamics of freshwater wetlands, relevant for nature conservation and\\nfuture climate change.\\n   \n",

The lower premolar series is relatively long: the premolar/molar index varies\\nbetween [NUMBER].[NUMBER] and [NUMBER].[NUMBER]% (M = [NUMBER].[NUMBER]%, n = [NUMBER]). The lower tooth series proportion is very close to those of\\nthe deer samples from Untermassfeld (M = [NUMBER].[NUMBER]%, n = [NUMBER]) and Perrier-Etouaires (M = [NUMBER].[NUMBER]%, n = [NUMBER]),\\nand relatively longer than in the sample of Eucladoceros from Seneze (M = [NUMBER].[NUMBER]%, n = [NUMBER]) (Figure 6A).\\nP4 normally is primitive, non-molarized; its parastilid and paraconid are separated; metaconid is\\nrounded and somewhat extended posteriorly due to the extension of its posterior wing. In one case\\n(the specimen BUG-[NUMBER]), the metaconid of P4 gets in touch with the entoconid, and it almost closes\\nthe valley between metaconid and entoconid (Figure [NUMBER]).\\n  \n",

This method can create virtual sources and receivers\\nin the subsurface (Wapenaar et al., [NUMBER]; Slob et al., [NUMBER]).\\nIn order to achieve this, the method requires a reflection response recorded at the surface of the Earth and an estimation\\nof the first arrival of the signal from a location in the subsurface to the receiver locations in the measurement array.\\nThis first arrival can be estimated from a background velocity model, which requires no detailed information about\\nthe subsurface. Through the Marchenko method, the Green's\\nfunction with a virtual receiver in the subsurface can be retrieved. Using this method, many virtual receivers can be\\ncreated in the subsurface, which can be used to monitor the\\nwave field from the virtual receiver locations to the receiver\\narray. To obtain the signal between an induced signal from\\nthe subsurface and the virtual receiver locations, homogeneous Green's function retrieval can be employed; however,\\nas pointed out before, the classical retrieval scheme would\\ninclude artifacts due to the open surface of the recording.\\nThese artifacts can disturb the interpretation of the signal.\\nAn alternative retrieval scheme was developed by Wapenaar\\net al. ([NUMBER]), who showed that if a focusing function is used\\nin combination with a Green's function, an open surface can\\nbe used for the retrieval instead of an enclosing one, without\\nthe artifacts of the classical method when applied to an open\\nsurface. A focusing function is a wave field that is designed\\nto focus at a location in the subsurface and can be retrieved\\nfrom reflection data using the Marchenko method (van der\\nNeut et al., [NUMBER]).

It is important to note, in addition, that the examples expounded upon in\\nthis paper are dominantly from intraplate regions, where the only viable mechanism for driving and\\nsustaining vertical crustal motions is the lower-crustal displacement described above, giving rise to\\n'regional' or 'epeirogenic' uplift rather than the increases in relief that can occur in plate-boundary\\nzones as a result of plate-tectonic processes or the effects of active faulting. The latter can of course\\nalso give rise to localized vertical crustal motions, often overprinted onto a regional (epeirogenic)\\npattern of movement (e.g., [[NUMBER],[NUMBER],[NUMBER]]). A discussion of mechanisms of tectonic/atectonic uplift is not\\nfundamental to this review paper, which is not the place to expand upon the various models.

       "85079   Abstract: We studied twelve late Holocene organic deposits in West-Frisia, The Netherlands. Pollen,\\nspores, non-pollen palynomorphs, mosses, other botanical macrofossils and insect remains were\\nrecorded for reconstructions of changing environmental conditions. Eastern West-Frisia was a\\ncultivated landscape during the Bronze Age, but it became a freshwater wetland in the Late Bronze\\nAge. In most of our sites, radiocarbon dates show that time transgressive inundation of soils preceded\\nthe climate shift at [NUMBER] cal BC for several centuries. We suggest that solar forcing of climate change may\\nhave delivered the final push to the inundation and depopulation of West-Frisia, which had already\\ncommenced several centuries before, due to sealevel rise. We did not find evidence for significant\\nBronze Age tree growth in West-Frisia before the inundations. Vegetation successions in the new\\nwetlands developed from shallow mineral-rich freshwater to rich-fen vegetation. Subsequently poor\\nfen vegetation with birch and pine developed, and the natural succession led to ombrotrophic raised\\nbog vegetation. Complete successions from shallow, mineral-rich lakes to raised bog lasted between\\n[NUMBER] and [NUMBER] calendar years. We hypothesize that medieval drainage and reclamation became\\npossible only when the mires of West-Frisia had reached the raised bog stage. Reclamation of raised\\nbogs by medieval farmers (drainage, eutrophication, peat digging) caused compaction, oxidation and\\nloss of the upper part of the peat deposit. Seeds of salt-tolerant and salt-demanding plant species\\nindicate that the medieval sites were inundated during storm surges with brackish or salt water, which\\ntriggered the farmers to build artificial mounds and, later, dikes. Under mounds and dikes, peat\\ndeposits remained protected against further decay. With our data we deliver a long-term perspective\\non contemporary ecosystem dynamics of freshwater wetlands, relevant for nature conservation and\\nfuture climate change.\\n  \n",
