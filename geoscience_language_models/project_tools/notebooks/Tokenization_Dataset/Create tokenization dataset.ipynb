However, the main challenge remains improving their performance in cold climates. This paper represents the first step of a larger research project for the implementation of the zeotropic refrigerant mixtures in order to increase the performance of residential air-source heat pumps in cold climates. A detailed screening heat pump model is developed and used to assess the performance of zeotropic refrigerant mixtures. A group of pure refrigerants are selected and their potential mixtures are studied. The performance of these mixtures is compared in order to find suitable zeotropic refrigerant mixtures for cold climate residential applications. The main goal of this paper is to illustrate the possibility of applying environmentally friendly zeotropic refrigerant mixtures in conventional heat pumps, with minimal changes in the components, in order to improve their performance.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Absolute gravity and GRACE satellite data have been combined with GPS data to identify a large-scale water storage anomaly on the Canadian prairies. Monthly GRACE data for the period 2002-2011 were used to produce a gravity rate map of the northern mid-continent. This map was corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) using a GPS-based, vertical velocity map derived from 27 continuous and over 50 campaign sites, combined over the period 1996-2010. The vertical velocity map used to correct for GIA was first converted into a virtual gravity rate map using a linear relationship between surface gravity rate and vertical velocity (-0.16 microGal/mm), empirically derived from combined annual absolute gravity and continuous GPS observations at 7 sites outside the anomalous area. The corrected GRACE gravity rate map reveals a major mass rate anomaly with a water equivalent thickness rate of around 3 cm/yr and approximate dimensions of 600 km (N-S) and 800 km (E-W) centered on the Manitoba-Saskatchewan border. The amplitude and spatial extent of the anomaly are estimated by data inversion, taking into account the effect of elastic loading on the GPS-based GIA correction. The source of the anomaly is confirmed by records from deep observation wells in Saskatchewan to be an increase in total water content from 2002 to 2011, amounting to an overall water equivalent accumulation of around 27 cm over a wide area.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Newmarket Till is a stony, sandy (38%) silty (~47%) diamicton, which is of variable thickness (~1 - 69 m) and of widespread distribution in Southern Ontario. The Newmarket Till has unusually high densities (2.2 - 2.4 g/cm3); elevated seismic velocities (Vp ~2600 m/s) determined by downhole geophysical studies are characteristic and the Till can be traced across the region as a seismostratigraphic marker. As the Till is highly indurated and has low permeability, it forms a regional aquitard that confines underlying aquifers, and is also a basal aquitard for overlying aquifers (e.g. Oak Ridges Moraine). Given the high sand content of this diamicton, the low permeability and indurated nature is surprising, and could be resultant from over-consolidation due to glacial loading, presence of a secondary cement, or both processes. Recent observations from drill core and surficial sampling transects illustrate that Newmarket Till is not always cemented, but the observation of residual cement on pebbles indicates it was potentially formerly cemented. Our new studies indicate that the matrix of the Dummer moraine (adjacent to and south of the Shield - Paleozoic boundary and to the north of the Newmarket Till) is mineralogically and geochemically equivalent to Newmarket Till, and we thus suggest the Dummer Moraine is a very stone- to boulder-rich equivalent of the Newmarket Till. The matrix mineral assemblage of the Till (in decreasing abundance) is quartz, calcite, K-feldspar, plagioclase, dolomite, amphibole and clinopyroxene; these grains are comminuted and range in size from ~2000 ?m to ~2 ?m, leading to optimum packing, and potentially over-consolidation. The intra-grain matrix is exceptionally fine (&lt;1 ?m, typically 0.25 - 0.50 ?m) and not resolvable by optical methods. Higher resolution SEM and FE-SEM backscattered electron and secondary electron images of the intra-grain matrix reveals a complex pore filling cement. The minerals comprising the secondary cement are a challenge to analyze due to their very fine grain size and composition. Semi-quantitative EDS analyses indicate a calcite (CaCO3) cement with minor phyllosilicates, as confirmed by XRD on the clay-silt and clay fractions. The calcite cements the silt- to sand-sized mineral grains and larger clasts, and result in the Newmarket Till being highly indurated and of low permeability. The timing and process of the initial cementation event is currently being evaluated; we also note that in the vadose zone the Till becomes uncemented (i.e. the original calcite cement dissolves out).</td>\n",

Recent interpretation of these data provides a new and modified geometry of recent and past faulting within the Archipelagos. Previous structural mapping in the region was island and land based devoid of any marine data, but these new marine data and interpretations facilitate a better structural view. We present a comprehensive map of the geology that includes the Devil's Mountain and Skipjack Island fault zones, the Lopez Fracture zone, and intermediate faults that appear to facilitate rotation of the San Juan islands. In addition, the associated coastal and marine hazards of the region are presented with emphasis on local active faulting, mass wasting, and tsunami generation.</td>\n",

Mallik 5L-38 gas hydrate production research well; 2) validate and calibrate the numerical model; and 3) determine important parameters describing gas hydrate behaviour and dissociation. The initial conditions and properties of the gas hydrate deposit were determined using supporting geological and geophysical data. Direct measurements provided the necessary boundary conditions. The numerical model was calibrated against the cumulative volumes of produced gas, a process that increased confidence in the model. Two possible scenarios of thermal dissociation, using unadjusted and smoothed data, are proposed to interpret the field-test results. The parameters of the dominant physical processes are estimated by inverse modelling (history matching). Their results compare favourably with previously published data. Additionally, estimates of long-term production are made, and an alternative well configuration is proposed to substantially increase gas production.</td>\n",

However, the main challenge remains improving their performance in cold climates. This paper represents the first step of a larger research project for the implementation of the zeotropic refrigerant mixtures in order to increase the performance of residential air-source heat pumps in cold climates. A detailed screening heat pump model is developed and used to assess the performance of zeotropic refrigerant mixtures. A group of pure refrigerants are selected and their potential mixtures are studied. The performance of these mixtures is compared in order to find suitable zeotropic refrigerant mixtures for cold climate residential applications. The main goal of this paper is to illustrate the possibility of applying environmentally friendly zeotropic refrigerant mixtures in conventional heat pumps, with minimal changes in the components, in order to improve their performance.\n",

Monthly GRACE data for the period 2002-2011 were used to produce a gravity rate map of the northern mid-continent. This map was corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) using a GPS-based, vertical velocity map derived from 27 continuous and over 50 campaign sites, combined over the period 1996-2010. The vertical velocity map used to correct for GIA was first converted into a virtual gravity rate map using a linear relationship between surface gravity rate and vertical velocity (-0.16 microGal/mm), empirically derived from combined annual absolute gravity and continuous GPS observations at 7 sites outside the anomalous area. The corrected GRACE gravity rate map reveals a major mass rate anomaly with a water equivalent thickness rate of around 3 cm/yr and approximate dimensions of 600 km (N-S) and 800 km (E-W) centered on the Manitoba-Saskatchewan border. The amplitude and spatial extent of the anomaly are estimated by data inversion, taking into account the effect of elastic loading on the GPS-based GIA correction. The source of the anomaly is confirmed by records from deep observation wells in Saskatchewan to be an increase in total water content from 2002 to 2011, amounting to an overall water equivalent accumulation of around 27 cm over a wide area.\n",

       "85952  Newmarket Till is a stony, sandy (38%) silty (~47%) diamicton, which is of variable thickness (~1 - 69 m) and of widespread distribution in Southern Ontario. The Newmarket Till has unusually high densities (2.2 - 2.4 g/cm3); elevated seismic velocities (Vp ~2600 m/s) determined by downhole geophysical studies are characteristic and the Till can be traced across the region as a seismostratigraphic marker. As the Till is highly indurated and has low permeability, it forms a regional aquitard that confines underlying aquifers, and is also a basal aquitard for overlying aquifers (e.g. Oak Ridges Moraine). Given the high sand content of this diamicton, the low permeability and indurated nature is surprising, and could be resultant from over-consolidation due to glacial loading, presence of a secondary cement, or both processes. Recent observations from drill core and surficial sampling transects illustrate that Newmarket Till is not always cemented, but the observation of residual cement on pebbles indicates it was potentially formerly cemented. Our new studies indicate that the matrix of the Dummer moraine (adjacent to and south of the Shield - Paleozoic boundary and to the north of the Newmarket Till) is mineralogically and geochemically equivalent to Newmarket Till, and we thus suggest the Dummer Moraine is a very stone- to boulder-rich equivalent of the Newmarket Till. The matrix mineral assemblage of the Till (in decreasing abundance) is quartz, calcite, K-feldspar, plagioclase, dolomite, amphibole and clinopyroxene; these grains are comminuted and range in size from ~2000 ?m to ~2 ?m, leading to optimum packing, and potentially over-consolidation. The intra-grain matrix is exceptionally fine (<1 ?m, typically 0.25 - 0.50 ?m) and not resolvable by optical methods. Higher resolution SEM and FE-SEM backscattered electron and secondary electron images of the intra-grain matrix reveals a complex pore filling cement. The minerals comprising the secondary cement are a challenge to analyze due to their very fine grain size and composition. Semi-quantitative EDS analyses indicate a calcite (CaCO3) cement with minor phyllosilicates, as confirmed by XRD on the clay-silt and clay fractions. The calcite cements the silt- to sand-sized mineral grains and larger clasts, and result in the Newmarket Till being highly indurated and of low permeability. The timing and process of the initial cementation event is currently being evaluated; we also note that in the vadose zone the Till becomes uncemented (i.e. the original calcite cement dissolves out).\n",

Recent interpretation of these data provides a new and modified geometry of recent and past faulting within the Archipelagos. Previous structural mapping in the region was island and land based devoid of any marine data, but these new marine data and interpretations facilitate a better structural view. We present a comprehensive map of the geology that includes the Devil's Mountain and Skipjack Island fault zones, the Lopez Fracture zone, and intermediate faults that appear to facilitate rotation of the San Juan islands.

Mallik 5L-38 gas hydrate production research well; 2) validate and calibrate the numerical model; and 3) determine important parameters describing gas hydrate behaviour and dissociation. The initial conditions and properties of the gas hydrate deposit were determined using supporting geological and geophysical data. Direct measurements provided the necessary boundary conditions. The numerical model was calibrated against the cumulative volumes of produced gas, a process that increased confidence in the model. Two possible scenarios of thermal dissociation, using unadjusted and smoothed data, are proposed to interpret the field-test results. The parameters of the dominant physical processes are estimated by inverse modelling (history matching). Their results compare favourably with previously published data. Additionally, estimates of long-term production are made, and an alternative well configuration is proposed to substantially increase gas production.\n",
